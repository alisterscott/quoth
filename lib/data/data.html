<dd>18. To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time; and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more; it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. ~ <i><a href="/wiki/Macbeth" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a></dd>

<dd>13. As long as I am mayor of this city the great industries are secure. We hear about constitutional rights, free speech and the free press.

<dd>28. Certain old men prefer to rise at dawn, taking a cold bath and a long walk with an empty stomach and otherwise mortifying the flesh. They then point with pride to these practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe years; the truth being that they are hearty and old, not because of their habits, but in spite of them. The reason we find only robust persons doing this thing is that it has killed all the others who have tried it. ~ <i><a href="/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Dictionary" title="The Devil's Dictionary" class="mw-redirect">The Devil's Dictionary</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Ambrose_Bierce" title="Ambrose Bierce">Ambrose Bierce</a></dd>

<li>All the people of all the nations which had fought in the First World War were silent during the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour of Armistice Day, which was the eleventh day of the eleventh month. It was during that minute in nineteen hundred and eighteen, that millions upon millions of human beings stopped butchering one another. I have talked to old men who were on battlefields during that minute. They have told me in one way or another that the sudden silence was the Voice of God. So we still have among us some men who can remember when God spoke clearly to mankind. ~ <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut" title="Kurt Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a></li>

Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity.

<li>There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity.

<li>It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who, at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat. ~ <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a></li>

<li>You and I are told increasingly that we have to choose between a left or right, but I would like to suggest that there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down — up to a man's age-old dream; the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order — or down to the ant heap totalitarianism, and regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course. ~ <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a></li>
<li>He judged it not fit to determine anything rashly; and seemed to doubt whether those different forms of religion might not all come from God, who might inspire man in a different manner, and be pleased with this variety; he therefore thought it indecent and foolish for any man to threaten and terrify another to make him believe what did not appear to him to be true. ~ <a href="/wiki/Thomas_More" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a></li>
<li>There are, indeed, two forms of discontent: one laborious, the other indolent and complaining. We respect the man of laborious desire, but let us not suppose that his restlessness is peace, or his ambition meekness.

<li>A writer writes not because he is educated but because he is driven by the need to communicate. Behind the need to communicate is the need to share.

<li>The voice of the individual artist may seem perhaps of no more consequence than the whirring of a cricket in the grass, but the arts do live continuously, and they live literally by faith; their names and their shapes and their uses and their basic meanings survive unchanged in all that matters through times of interruption, diminishment, neglect; they outlive governments and creeds and the societies, even the very civilization that produced them.

<li>Faith is a continuum, and we each fall on that line where we may.

<li>What I do know for certain is that what is regarded as success in a rational materialistic society only impresses superficial minds. It amounts to nothing and will not help us rout the destructive forces threatening us today.

<li>I bow before the authority of special men because it is imposed on me by my own reason.

<li>The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong in the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially.

<li>Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. The detective must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man.

<li>All political movements are like this — we are in the right, everyone else is in the wrong. The people on our own side who disagree with us are heretics, and they start becoming enemies. With it comes an absolute conviction of your own moral superiority.

<li>Poems present their testimony as circumstantial evidences, not as closing argument.

<li>I love people. Everybody. I love them, I think, as a stamp collector loves his collection. Every story, every incident, every bit of conversation is raw material for me. My love's not impersonal yet not wholly subjective either. I would like to be everyone, a cripple, a dying man, a whore, and then come back to write about my thoughts, my emotions, as that person. But I am not omniscient. I have to live my life, and it is the only one I'll ever have. And you cannot regard your own life with objective curiosity all the time. ~ <a href="/wiki/Sylvia_Plath" title="Sylvia Plath">Sylvia Plath</a></li>

<li>The fundamental article of my political creed is that despotism, or unlimited sovereignty, or absolute power, is the same in a majority of a popular assembly, an aristocratical council, an oligarchical junto, and a single emperor.

But they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice or virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of an ignorance which fancies it knows everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill.

<li>Formerly we used to represent things visible on earth, things we either liked to look at or would have liked to see. Today we reveal the reality that is behind visible things, thus expressing the belief that the visible world is merely an isolated case in relation to the universe and that there are many more other, latent realities.

Imagine a world in which we saw beyond the lines that divide us, and celebrated our differences, instead of hiding from them.

<li>If the fires of freedom and civil liberties burn low in other lands they must be made brighter in our own.

<li>The counsels of impatience and hatred can always be supported by the crudest and cheapest symbols; for the counsels of moderation, the reasons are often intricate, rather than emotional, and difficult to explain.

<li>Of course, there is no doubt that if we lived in a police state, it would be easier to catch terrorists.

<li>I judge a man by his actions with men, much more than by his declarations Godwards.

<li>The life, the fortune, and the happiness of every one of us, and, more or less, of those who are connected with us, do depend upon our knowing something of the rules of a game infinitely more difficult and complicated than chess. It is a game which has been played for untold ages, every man and woman of us being one of the two players in a game of his or her own. The chessboard is the world, the pieces are the phenomena of the universe, the rules of the game are what we call the laws of Nature. The player on the other side is hidden from us.

<li>Nothing appears more surprising to those, who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye, than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few; and the implicit submission, with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers. When we enquire by what means this wonder is effected, we shall find, that, as Force is always on the side of the governed, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion. It is therefore, on opinion only that government is founded; and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments, as well as to the most free and most popular. ~ <a href="/wiki/David_Hume" title="David Hume">David Hume</a></li>

<li>We are all, always, the desire not to die. This desire is as immeasurable and varied as life's complexity, but at bottom this is what it is: To continue to <i>be,</i> to <i>be</i> more and more, to develop and to endure. All the force we have, all our energy and clearness of mind serve to intensify themselves in one way or another. We intensify ourselves with new impressions, new sensations, new ideas. We endeavour to take what we do not have and to add it to ourselves. Humanity is the desire for novelty founded upon the fear of death.

<li>The opposition of instinct and reason is mainly illusory. Instinct, intuition, or insight is what first leads to the beliefs which subsequent reason confirms or confutes; but the confirmation, where it is possible, consists, in the last analysis, of agreement with other beliefs no less instinctive.

<li>I have the same idea with all my books: an attempt to come close to the core of reality, the structure of reality, as opposed to the merely superficial. The realistic novel is remote from art. A novel should heighten life, should give one an illuminating experience; it shouldn't set out what you know already. I just muddle away at it. One gets flashes here and there, which help.

<li>The pessimist is commonly spoken of as the man in revolt. He is not. Firstly, because it requires some cheerfulness to continue in revolt, and secondly, because pessimism appeals to the weaker side of everybody, and the pessimist, therefore, drives as roaring a trade as the publican. The person who is really in revolt is the optimist, who generally lives and dies in a desperate and suicidal effort to persuade all the other people how good they are. It has been proved a hundred times over that if you really wish to enrage people and make them angry, even unto death, the right way to do it is to tell them that they are all the sons of God. ~ <a href="/wiki/G._K._Chesterton" title="G.

Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them — if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you.

<li>We depend on our words ... Our task is to communicate experience and ideas to others. We must strive continually to extend the scope of our description, but in such a way that our messages do not thereby lose their objective or unambiguous character ... We are suspended in language in such a way that we cannot say what is up and what is down. The word "reality" is also a word, a word which we must learn to use correctly. ~ <a href="/wiki/Niels_Bohr" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a></li>
<li>The sequential nature of actual events is not illuminated with lengthy precision by the powers of prescience except under the most extraordinary circumstances. The oracle grasps incidents cut out of the historic chain. Eternity moves. It inflicts itself upon the oracle and the supplicant alike. Let Muad'Dib's subjects doubt his majesty and his oracular visions. Let them deny his powers. Let them never doubt Eternity. ~ <a href="/wiki/Frank_Herbert" title="Frank Herbert">Frank Herbert</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Dune" title="Dune">Dune Messiah</a></i></li>

<li>At all times, day by day, we have to continue fighting for freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom from want — for these are things that must be gained in peace as well as in war. ~ <a href="/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt" title="Eleanor Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a></li>
<li>Everything abstract is ultimately part of the concrete. Everything inanimate finally serves the living. That is why every activity dealing in abstraction stands in ultimate service to a living whole. ~ <a href="/wiki/Edith_Stein" title="Edith Stein">Edith Stein</a></li>
<li>I'm always astounded at the way we automatically look at what divides and separates us. We never look at what people have in common. If you see it, black and white people, both sides look to see the differences, they don't look at what they have together. Men and women, and old and young, and so on. And this is a disease of the mind, the way I see it. ~ <a href="/wiki/Doris_Lessing" title="Doris Lessing">Doris Lessing</a></li>
<li>There's an old African proverb that says "If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." We have to go far — quickly.

<li>Without art we would be nothing but foreground and live entirely in the spell of that perspective which makes what is closest at hand and most vulgar appear as if it were vast, and reality itself. ~ <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a></li>

<li>My conception of the audience is of a public each member of which is carrying about with him what he thinks is an anxiety, or a hope, or a preoccupation which is his alone and isolates him from mankind; and in this respect at least the function of a play is to reveal him to himself so that he may touch others by virtue of the revelation of his mutuality with them. If only for this reason I regard the theater as a serious business, one that makes or should make man more human, which is to say, less alone. ~ <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Miller" title="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</a></li>

<li>By the theory of our Government majorities rule, but this right is not an arbitrary or unlimited one. It is a right to be exercised in subordination to the Constitution and in conformity to it.

<li>Only those who dare to fail greatly, can ever achieve greatly. ... Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society.

<li>It requires twenty years for a man to rise from the vegetable state in which he is within his mother's womb, and from the pure animal state which is the lot of his early childhood, to the state when the maturity of reason begins to appear.

<li>Ultimately, leadership requires action: daring to take steps that are necessary but unpopular, challenging the status quo in order to reach a brighter future. And to push for peace is ultimately personal sacrifice, for leadership is not easy. It is born of a passion, and it is a commitment. Leadership is a commitment to an idea, to a dream, and to a vision of what can be.

<li>You don't get very far in life without having to be brave an awful lot.

<li>Man is appealed to to be guided in his acts, not merely by love, which is always personal, or at the best tribal, but by the perception of his oneness with each human being.

<li>Let us not forget that violence does not live alone and is not capable of living alone: it is necessarily interwoven with falsehood.

<li>This I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about. I can understand why a system built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind, for it is the one thing which can by inspection destroy such a system. Surely I can understand this, and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts.

<li>I think we should be very clear on this... this country was founded on the principles of the Enlightenment... It was the idea that people could talk, reason, have dialogue, discuss the issues. It wasn't founded on the idea that someone would get struck by a divine inspiration and know everything right from wrong. I mean, people who founded this country had religion, they had strong beliefs, but they believed in reason, in dialogue, in civil discourse. We can’t lose that in this country.

<li>Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world. You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding. No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives, and he lives forever.

<li>The greatest book is not the one whose message engraves itself on the brain, as a telegraphic message engraves itself on the ticker-tape, but the one whose vital impact opens up other viewpoints, and from writer to reader spreads the fire that is fed by the various essences, until it becomes a vast conflagration leaping from forest to forest. ~ <a href="/wiki/Romain_Rolland" title="Romain Rolland">Romain Rolland</a></li>

<li>What is wonderful about great literature is that it transforms the man who reads it towards the condition of the man who wrote, and brings to birth in us also the creative impulse. ~ <a href="/wiki/E._M._Forster" title="E. M. Forster">E. M. Forster</a></li>
<li>When people grow wise in one direction, they are sure to make it easier for themselves to grow wise in other directions as well. On the other hand, when they split up knowledge, concentrate on their own field, and scorn and ignore other fields, they grow less wise — even in their own field. ~ <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a></li>
<li>The rule of no realm is mine, neither of Gondor nor any other, great or small. But all worthy things that are in peril as the world now stands, those are my care. And for my part, I shall not wholly fail of my task, though Gondor should perish, if anything passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come. ~ "<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf" class="extiw" title="w:Gandalf">Gandalf</a>" in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>&#160;: <i><a href="/wiki/The_Return_of_the_King" title="The Return of the King">The Return of the King</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien" title="J.

<li>The main Business of natural Philosophy is to argue from Phenomena without feigning Hypotheses, and to deduce Causes from Effects, till we come to the very first Cause, which certainly is not mechanical. ~ <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a></li>
<li>A dreaded society is not a civilized society. The most progressive and powerful society in the civilized sense, is a society which has recognized its ethos, and come to terms with the past and the present, with religion and science, with modernism and mysticism, with materialism and spirituality; a society free of tension, a society rich in culture. Such a society cannot come with hocus-pocus formulas and with fraud. It has to flow from the depth of a divine search. ~ <a href="/wiki/Zulfikar_Ali_Bhutto" title="Zulfikar Ali Bhutto">Zulfikar Ali Bhutto</a></li>
<li>Yesterday we obeyed kings and bent our necks before emperors. But today we kneel only to truth, follow only beauty, and obey only love. ~ <a href="/wiki/Khalil_Gibran" title="Khalil Gibran">Khalil Gibran</a></li>
<li>You cannot begin to preserve any species of animal unless you preserve the habitat in which it dwells. Disturb or destroy that habitat and you will exterminate the species as surely as if you had shot it. So conservation means that you have to preserve forest and grassland, river and lake, even the sea itself. This is not only vital for the preservation of animal life generally, but for the future existence of man himself — a point that seems to escape many people. ~ <a href="/wiki/Gerald_Durrell" title="Gerald Durrell">Gerald Durrell</a></li>

<li>I believe that the Universe is one being, all its parts are different expressions of the same energy, and they are all in communication with each other, therefore parts of one organic whole. This whole is in all its parts so beautiful, and is felt by me to be so intensely in earnest, that I am compelled to love it and to think of it as divine. ~ <a href="/wiki/Robinson_Jeffers" title="Robinson Jeffers">Robinson Jeffers</a></li>
<li>I do indeed disbelieve that we or any other mortal men can attain on a given day to absolutely incorrigible and unimprovable truth about such matters of fact as those with which religions deal. But I reject this dogmatic ideal not out of a perverse delight in intellectual instability. I am no lover of disorder and doubt as such. Rather do I fear to lose truth by this pretension to possess it already wholly. ~ <a href="/wiki/William_James" title="William James">William James</a></li>

<li>The explorers of the past were great men and we should honour them. But let us not forget that their spirit lives on. It is still not hard to find a man who will adventure for the sake of a dream or one who will search, for the pleasure of searching, not for what he may find. ~ <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Hillary" title="Edmund Hillary">Sir Edmund Hillary</a></li>
<li>At no time are we ever in such complete possession of a journey, down to its last nook and cranny, as when we are busy with preparations for it.

<li>I'm concerned about justice. I'm concerned about brotherhood. I'm concerned about truth. And when one is concerned about these, he can never advocate violence. For through violence you may murder a murderer but you can't murder murder. Through violence you may murder a liar but you can't establish truth. Through violence you may murder a hater, but you can't murder hate. Darkness cannot put out darkness. Only light can do that. ~ <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a></li>

<li>All true histories contain instruction; though, in some, the treasure may be hard to find, and when found, so trivial in quantity, that the dry, shrivelled kernel scarcely compensates for the trouble of cracking the nut. Whether this be the case with my history or not, I am hardly competent to judge. I sometimes think it might prove useful to some, and entertaining to others; but the world may judge for itself. Shielded by my own obscurity, and by the lapse of years, and a few fictitious names, I do not fear to venture; and will candidly lay before the public what I would not disclose to the most intimate friend. ~ <a href="/wiki/Anne_Bront%C3%AB" title="Anne Brontë">Anne Brontë</a></li>

<li><i>From childhood's hour I have not been<br />
As others were — I have not seen<br />

My passions from a common spring —<br />

My sorrow — I could not awaken<br />

And all I lov'd — <b>I</b> lov'd alone.</i><br />

<li>I love child things because there's so much mystery when you're a child. When you're a child, something as simple as a tree doesn't make sense. You see it in the distance and it looks small, but as you go closer, it seems to grow — you haven't got a handle on the rules when you're a child. We think we understand the rules when we become adults but what we really experienced is a narrowing of the imagination. ~ <a href="/wiki/David_Lynch" title="David Lynch">David Lynch</a></li>
<li>If the general government should persist in the measures now threatened, there must be war. It is painful enough to discover with what unconcern they speak of war and threaten it.

<li><i>So, we'll go no more a roving<br />

<li>The fear of freedom is strong in us. We call it chaos or anarchy, and the words are threatening. We live in a true chaos of contradicting authorities, an age of conformism without community, of proximity without communication. We could only fear chaos if we imagined that it was unknown to us, but in fact we know it very well. ~ <a href="/wiki/Germaine_Greer" title="Germaine Greer">Germaine Greer</a></li>
<li>We do not see faith, hope, and charity as unattainable ideals, but we use them as stout supports of a nation fighting the fight for freedom in a modern civilization.<br />
Faith — in the soundness of democracy in the midst of dictatorships.<br />
Hope — renewed because we know so well the progress we have made.<br />
Charity — in the true spirit of that grand old word. For charity literally translated from the original means love, the love that understands, that does not merely share the wealth of the giver, but in true sympathy and wisdom helps men to help themselves. ~ <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D.

<li>At this point in history, the most radical, pervasive, and earth-shaking transformation would occur simply if everybody truly evolved to a mature, rational, and responsible ego, capable of freely participating in the open exchange of mutual self-esteem. <i>There</i> is the "edge of history."

<li>When war is waged it is for the purpose of safeguarding or increasing one's capacity to make war. International politics are wholly involved in this vicious cycle. What is called national prestige consists in behaving always in such a way as to demoralize other nations by giving them the impression that, if it comes to war, one would certainly defeat them. What is called national security is an imaginary state of affairs in which one would retain the capacity to make war while depriving all other countries of it. ~ <a href="/wiki/Simone_Weil" title="Simone Weil">Simone Weil</a></li>

<li>Let’s talk sense to the American people. Let’s tell them the truth, that there are no gains without pains, that we are now on the eve of great decisions, not easy decisions, like resistance when you're attacked, but a long, patient, costly struggle which alone can assure triumph over the great enemies of man — war, poverty, and tyranny — and the assaults upon human dignity which are the most grievous consequences of each. ~ <a href="/wiki/Adlai_Stevenson" title="Adlai Stevenson">Adlai Stevenson</a></li>
<li>I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing. So, with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let us renew our faith and our hope. We have every right to dream heroic dreams.

<li>The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to <i>see</i> something, and tell what it <i>saw</i> in a plain way.

<li>Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<br />
Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.<br />
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.<br />
And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. ~ <a href="/wiki/Paul_of_Tarsus" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul of Tarsus</a></li>
<li>Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions, and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us. ~ <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a></li>
<li>Public opinion, or what passes for public opinion, is not invariably a moderating force in the jungle of politics. It may be true, and I suspect it is, that the mass of people everywhere are normally peace-loving and would accept many restraints and sacrifices in preference to the monstrous calamities of war. But I also suspect that what purports to be public opinion in most countries that consider themselves to have popular government is often not really the consensus of the feelings of the mass of the people at all, but rather the expression of the interests of special highly vocal minorities — politicians, commentators, and publicity-seekers of all sorts: people who live by their ability to draw attention to themselves and die, like fish out of water, if they are compelled to remain silent. ~ <a href="/wiki/George_F._Kennan" title="George F.

<li>Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what a people will submit to, and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them; and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.

Past thinking and methods did not prevent world wars. Future thinking must prevent wars ... The stakes are immense, the task colossal, the time is short. But we may hope — we must hope — that man’s own creation, man’s own genius, will not destroy him. ~ <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a></li>
<li>As long as our government is administered for the good of the people, and is regulated by their will; as long as it secures to us the rights of person and property, liberty of conscience, and of the press, it will be worth defending. ~ <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a></li>
<li>Wherever the real power in a Government lies, there is the danger of oppression. In our Governments, the real power lies in the majority of the Community, and the invasion of private rights is <i>chiefly</i> to be apprehended, not from the acts of Government contrary to the sense of its constituents, but from acts in which the Government is the mere instrument of the major number of the Constituents. ~ <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" title="James Madison">James Madison</a></li>
<li>Let anyone laugh and taunt if he so wishes.

<li>If we have learned one thing from the history of invention and discovery, it is that, in the long run — and often in the short one — the most daring prophecies seem laughably conservative. ~ <a href="/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke" title="Arthur C. Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a></li>
<li>If Spring came but once in a century, instead of once a year, or burst forth with the sound of an earthquake, and not in silence, what wonder and expectation there would be in all hearts to behold the miraculous change! But now the silent succession suggests nothing but necessity. To most men only the cessation of the miracle would be miraculous and the perpetual exercise of God's power seems less wonderful than its withdrawal would be. ~ <a href="/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow" title="Henry Wadsworth Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a></li>
<li>Music and silence... combine strongly because music is done with silence, and silence is full of music. ~ <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Marceau" title="Marcel Marceau">Marcel Marceau</a></li>
<li>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.<br />
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.<br />

<li>Political rights do not exist because they have been legally set down on a piece of paper, but only when they have become the ingrown habit of a people, and when any attempt to impair them will meet with the violent resistance of the populace. Where this is not the case, there is no help in any parliamentary Opposition or any Platonic appeals to the constitution. One compels respect from others when he knows how to defend his dignity as a human being. ~ <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Rocker" title="Rudolf Rocker">Rudolf Rocker</a></li>
<li>People say that what we're all seeking is a meaning for life. I don't think that's what we're really seeking. I think what we're seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonance within our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive. That's what it's all finally about. ~ <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Campbell" title="Joseph Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a></li>
<li>At this point in history when all things which concern man and the structure and elements of history itself are suddenly revealed to us in a new light, it behooves us in our scientific thinking to become masters of the situation, for it is not inconceivable that sooner than we suspect, as has often been the case before in history, this vision may disappear, the opportunity may be lost, and the world will once again present a static, uniform, and inflexible countenance. ~ <a href="/wiki/Karl_Mannheim" title="Karl Mannheim">Karl Mannheim</a></li>
<li>Just as we cannot stop the movement of the heavens, revolving as they do with such speed, so we cannot restrain our thought. And then we send all the faculties of the soul after it, thinking we are lost, and have misused the time that we are spending in the presence of God. Yet the soul may perhaps be wholly united with Him in the Mansions very near His presence, while thought remains in the outskirts of the castle, suffering the assaults of a thousand wild and venomous creatures and from this suffering winning merit. So this must not upset us, and we must not abandon the struggle, as the devil tries to make us do. Most of these trials and times of unrest come from the fact that we do not understand ourselves. ~ <a href="/wiki/Teresa_of_Avila" title="Teresa of Avila" class="mw-redirect">Teresa of Avila</a></li>
<li><i>I have known exile and a wild passion<br />

<li>Do you know what makes the prison disappear? Every deep, genuine affection. Being friends, being brothers, loving, that is what opens the prison, with supreme power, by some magic force.

<li><i>Let us roll all our strength and all<br />

Stand still, yet we will make him run.</i><br />

<li>What is unique about the "I" hides itself exactly in what is unimaginable about a person. All we are able to imagine is what makes everyone like everyone else, what people have in common. The individual "I" is what differs from the common stock, that is, what cannot be guessed at or calculated, what must be unveiled, uncovered, conquered. ~ <a href="/wiki/Milan_Kundera" title="Milan Kundera">Milan Kundera</a></li>
<li>Forgiveness is the offspring of a feeling of heroism, of a noble heart, of a generous mind, whilst forgetfulness is only the result of a weak memory, or of an easy carelessness, and still oftener of a natural desire for calm and quietness. Hatred, in the course of time, kills the unhappy wretch who delights in nursing it in his bosom. ~ <a href="/wiki/Giacomo_Casanova" title="Giacomo Casanova">Giacomo Casanova</a></li>

<li>Experience is never limited, and it is never complete; it is an immense sensibility, a kind of huge spider-web of the finest silken threads suspended in the chamber of consciousness, and catching every air-borne particle in its tissue. It is the very atmosphere of the mind; and when the mind is imaginative — much more when it happens to be that of a man of genius — it takes to itself the faintest hints of life, it converts the very pulses of the air into revelations. ~ <a href="/wiki/Henry_James" title="Henry James">Henry James</a></li>

<li>I am not a novelist, really not even a writer; I am a storyteller. One of my friends said about me that I think all sorrows can be borne if you put them into a story or tell a story about them, and perhaps this is not entirely untrue.

<li>The true secret in being a hero lies in knowing the order of things. ... Things must happen when it is time for them to happen.

<li>How hard to realize that every camp of men or beast has this glorious starry firmament for a roof!

<li>If nature has been frugal in her gifts and endowments, there is the more need of art to supply her defects. If she has been generous and liberal, know that she still expects industry and application on our part, and revenges herself in proportion to our negligent ingratitude.

<li>Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars — mere globs of gas atoms. Nothing is "mere". I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination — stuck on this carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern — of which I am a part...

<li>Errors now almost universally exist, and must be overcome solely by the force of reason; and as reason, to effect the most beneficial purposes, makes her advance by slow degrees, and progressively substantiates one truth of high import after another, it will be evident, to minds of comprehensive and accurate thought, that by these and similar compromises alone can success be rationally expected in practice.

<li>The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it.

<li>When you're 50 you start thinking about things you haven’t thought about before. I used to think getting old was about vanity — but actually it's about losing people you love. Getting wrinkles is trivial. ~ <a href="/wiki/Joyce_Carol_Oates" title="Joyce Carol Oates">Joyce Carol Oates</a></li>
<li>Our security strategies have not yet caught up with the risks we are facing.

<li>By "nationalism" I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled "good" or "bad." ... By "patriotism" I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force on other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseperable from the desire for power. ~ <a href="/wiki/George_Orwell" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a></li>

<li>Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally. Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild-goose chase, and is never attained. Follow some other object, and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it. ~ <a href="/wiki/Nathaniel_Hawthorne" title="Nathaniel Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a></li>
<li>Take a commonplace, clean it and polish it, light it so that it produces the same effect of youth and freshness and originality and spontaneity as it did originally, and you have done a poet’s job. The rest is literature. ~ <a href="/wiki/Jean_Cocteau" title="Jean Cocteau">Jean Cocteau</a></li>
<li>I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast; for I intend to go in harm's way. ~ <a href="/wiki/John_Paul_Jones" title="John Paul Jones">John Paul Jones</a></li>
<li>Do not confuse "duty" with what other people expect of you; they are utterly different. Duty is a debt you owe to yourself to fulfill obligations you have assumed voluntarily. Paying that debt can entail anything from years of patient work to instant willingness to die. Difficult it may be, but the reward is self-respect. ~ <a href="/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein" title="Robert A. Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a></li>
<li>As far as service goes, it can take the form of a million things. To do service, you don't have to be a doctor working in the slums for free, or become a social worker.

<li>Sailors have an expression about the weather: they say the weather is a great bluffer. I guess the same is true of our human society — things can look dark, then a break shows in the clouds, and all is changed. ~ <a href="/wiki/E._B._White" title="E. B. White">E. B. White</a></li>
<li>To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.

<li>People sometimes tell me that they prefer barbarism to civilisation. I doubt if they have given it a long enough trial.

<li>The note of hope is the only note that can help us or save us from falling to the bottom of the heap of evolution, because, largely, about all a human being is, anyway, is just a hoping machine, a working machine ... don't worry — the human race will sing this way as long as there is a human to race. The human race is a pretty old place. ~ <a href="/wiki/Woody_Guthrie" title="Woody Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a></li>
<li>Try to put well in practice what you already know; and in so doing, you will in good time, discover the hidden things which you now inquire about. Practice what you know, and it will help to make clear what now you do not know. ~ <a href="/wiki/Rembrandt" title="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a></li>
<li>Ignorance perpetuates itself just as knowledge does. Men write false documents, they preach false doctrine, and those beliefs survive to inspire wickedness in later generations. ... Conversely, some men write and teach about the truth, only to be declared heretic by the wicked. In such cases evil has the advantage, for it will do anything to suppress truth, but the good man limits what he will do to suppress falsehood.<br />
One might almost make a rule of it: "Whoever declares another heretic is himself a devil. Whoever places a relic or artifact above justice, kindness, mercy, or truth is himself a devil and the thing elevated is a work of evil magic." ~ <a href="/wiki/Sheri_S._Tepper" title="Sheri S.

<li><i>Error is a hardy plant; it flourisheth in every soil;<br />

Nor is any poison so deadly, that it serveth not some wholesome use.</i><br />

<li>Throughout history, it has been the inaction of those who could have acted, the indifference of those who should have known better, the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most, that has made it possible for evil to triumph. ~ <a href="/wiki/Haile_Selassie_I_of_Ethiopia" title="Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia" class="mw-redirect">Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia</a></li>

<li>Though ours is a godless age, it is the very opposite of irreligious. The true believer is everywhere on the march, and both by converting and antagonizing he is shaping the world in his own image.

<li>We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect; we apprehend it just as much by feeling.

<li>The future of humanity is uncertain, even in the most prosperous countries, and the quality of life deteriorates; and yet I believe that what is being discovered about the infinitely large and infinitely small is sufficient to absolve this end of the century and millennium.

<li>All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks.

<li>I have tried at times to place humans in perspective against the vastness of universal time and space.

<li>The principal goal of education in the schools should be creating men and women who are capable of doing new things, not simply repeating what other generations have done; men and women who are creative, inventive and discoverers, who can be critical and verify, and not accept, everything they are offered. ~ <a href="/wiki/Jean_Piaget" title="Jean Piaget">Jean Piaget</a></li>
<li>We are living in a time of trouble and bewilderment, in a time when none of us can foresee or foretell the future. But surely it is in times like these, when so much that we cherish is threatened or in jeopardy, that we are impelled all the more to strengthen our inner resources, to turn to the things that have no news value because they will be the same to-morrow that they were to-day and yesterday — the things that last, the things that the wisest, the most farseeing of our race and kind have been inspired to utter in forms that can inspire ourselves in turn. ~ <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Binyon" title="Laurence Binyon">Laurence Binyon</a></li>

<li>It has always seemed strange to me that in our endless discussions about education so little stress is laid on the pleasure of becoming an educated person, the enormous interest it adds to life.

<li>It is our hope, that men in proportion as they grow more enlightened, will learn to hold their theories and their creeds more loosely, and will none the less, nay, rather all the more be devoted to the supreme end of practical righteousness to which all theories and creeds must be kept subservient. ~ <a href="/wiki/Felix_Adler" title="Felix Adler">Felix Adler</a></li>

<li>A writer — and, I believe, generally all persons — must think that whatever happens to him or her is a resource. All things have been given to us for a purpose, and an artist must feel this more intensely.

<li>In every science, after having analysed the ideas, expressing the more complicated by means of the more simple, one finds a certain number that cannot be reduced among them, and that one can define no further.

<li>To which of the warring serpents should I turn with the problem that now faces me?<br />
It is easy, and tempting, to choose the god of Science. Now I would not for a moment have you suppose that I am one of those idiots who scorns Science, merely because it is always twisting and turning, and sometimes shedding its skin, like the serpent that is its symbol. It is a powerful god indeed but it is what the students of ancient gods called a shape-shifter, and sometimes a trickster. ~ <a href="/wiki/Robertson_Davies" title="Robertson Davies">Robertson Davies</a></li>
<li>Mankind has advanced. Human progress is ceaseless. We can ... conclude that building just societies is a fool's errand.

<li>Patriotism is proud of a country’s virtues and eager to correct its deficiencies; it also acknowledges the legitimate patriotism of other countries, with their own specific virtues. The pride of nationalism, however, trumpets its country’s virtues and denies its deficiencies, while it is contemptuous toward the virtues of other countries.

<li>The concept which assumes that everything in the Church is irrevocably set for all times appears to me to be a false one.

<li>You must not change one thing, one pebble, one grain of sand, until you know what good and evil will follow on that act. The world is in balance, in Equilibrium.

<li>I often observed to my brother, You see now how little nature requires to be satisfied. Felicity, the companion of content, is rather found in our own breasts than in the enjoyment of external things; And I firmly believe it requires but a little philosophy to make a man happy in whatsoever state he is.

<li>This is our time — to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope.

<li>Do not be deceived by the way men of bad faith misuse words and names ...Things are set up as contraries that are not even in the same category.

Thus I will describe myself as a radical conservative liberal; but certain of the tainted red fish will swear that there can be no such fish as that.

<li>If your object is to secure liberty, you must learn to do without authority and compulsion. If you intend to live in peace and harmony with your fellow-men, you and they should cultivate brotherhood and respect for each other. If you want to work together with them for your mutual benefit, you must practice cooperation. The social revolution means much more than the reorganization of conditions only: it means the establishment of new human values and social relationships, a changed attitude of man to man, as of one free and independent to his equal; it means a different spirit in individual and collective life, and that spirit cannot be born overnight.

These truths challenge each other, recoil from each other, reflect each other, ignore each other, tease each other, are blind to each other. Sometimes you feel you have the truth of a moment in your hand, then it slips through your fingers and is lost. ~ <a href="/wiki/Harold_Pinter" title="Harold Pinter">Harold Pinter</a></li>
<li>Nothing is so galling to a people not broken in from the birth as a paternal, or, in other words, a meddling government, a government which tells them what to read, and say, and eat, and drink and wear. ~ <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Babington_Macaulay,_1st_Baron_Macaulay" title="Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay">Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay</a></li>
<li>The love of one's country is a splendid thing. But why should love stop at the border? There is a brotherhood among all men. This must be recognized if life is to remain. We must learn the love of man. ~ <a href="/wiki/Pablo_Casals" title="Pablo Casals">Pablo Casals</a></li>

<li>This is an ancient hallow, and ere the kings failed or the Tree withered in the court, a fruit must have been set here.

<li>In my great tiredness and discouragement, the phrase "Reverence for Life" struck me like a flash. As far as I knew, it was a phrase I had never heard nor ever read. I realized at once that it carried within itself the solution to the problem that had been torturing me. Now I knew that a system of values which concerns itself only with our relationship to other people is incomplete and therefore lacking in power for good. Only by means of reverence for life can we establish a spiritual and humane relationship with both people and all living creatures within our reach. Only in this fashion can we avoid harming others, and, within the limits of our capacity, go to their aid whenever they need us. ~ <a href="/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer" title="Albert Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a></li>
<li>I know that love is ultimately the only answer to mankind's problems. And I'm going to talk about it everywhere I go. I know it isn't popular to talk about it in some circles today. I'm not talking about emotional bosh when I talk about love, I'm talking about a strong, demanding love. And I have seen too much hate... I have decided to love. If you are seeking the highest good, I think you can find it through love. And the beautiful thing is that we are moving against wrong when we do it, because John was right, God is love. He who hates does not know God, but he who has love has the key that unlocks the door to the meaning of ultimate reality. ~ <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a></li>

<li>There's new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair. The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep.

<li>Was a revelation to be made known to us, it must be accommodated to our external senses, and also to our reason, so that we could come at the perception and understanding of it, the same as we do to that of things in general. We must perceive by our senses, before we can reflect with the mind. ~ <a href="/wiki/Ethan_Allen" title="Ethan Allen">Ethan Allen</a></li>
<li>Honor is, or should be, the place of virtue and as in nature, things move violently to their place, and calmly in their place, so virtue in ambition is violent, in authority settled and calm. All rising to great place is by a winding stair; and if there be factions, it is good to side a man's self, whilst he is in the rising, and to balance himself when he is placed. ~ <a href="/wiki/Francis_Bacon" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a></li>

<li>How long can men thrive between walls of brick, walking on asphalt pavements, breathing the fumes of coal and of oil, growing, working, dying, with hardly a thought of wind, and sky, and fields of grain, seeing only machine-made beauty, the mineral-like quality of life. This is our modern danger — one of the waxen wings of flight. It may cause our civilization to fall unless we act quickly to counteract it, unless we realize that human character is more important than efficiency, that education consists of more than the mere accumulation of knowledge. ~ <a href="/wiki/Charles_Lindbergh" title="Charles Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a></li>
<li>All progress has resulted from people who took unpopular positions. All change is the result of a change in the contemporary state of mind. Don't be afraid of being out of tune with your environment, and above all pray God that you are not afraid to live, to live hard and fast. To my way of thinking it is not the years in your life but the life in your years that count in the long run. You'll have more fun, you'll do more and you'll get more, you'll give more satisfaction the more you know, the more you have worked, and the more you have lived.

<li>Man's constitution is so peculiar that his health is purely a negative matter. No sooner is the rage of hunger appeased than it becomes difficult to comprehend the meaning of starvation.

<li>I have seen the truth; I have seen and I know that people can be beautiful and happy without losing the power of living on earth.

I love thee to the level of everyday's<br />
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.<br />
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;<br />
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.<br />
I love thee with the passion put to use<br />
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.<br />
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose<br />
With my lost saints, — I love thee with the breath,<br />
Smiles, tears, of all my life! — and, if God choose,<br />
I shall but love thee better after death.<br />

<li>The Citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for giving to Mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights.

<li>We cannot avoid conflict, conflict with society, other individuals and with oneself.

<li>Life to each individual is a scene of continued feasting in a region of plenty; and when unexpected death arrests its course, it repays with small interest the large debt which it has contracted to the common fund of animal nutrition, from whence the materials of its body have been derived. Thus the great drama of universal life is perpetually sustained; and though the individual actors undergo continual change, the same parts are filled by another and another generation; renewing the face of the earth and the bosom of the deep with endless successions of life and happiness. ~ <a href="/wiki/William_Buckland" title="William Buckland">William Buckland</a></li>
<li>The joy of life discovered by the Greeks is not a profane type of enjoyment: it reveals the bliss of existing, of sharing — even fugitively — in the spontaneity of life and the majesty of the world.

<li>Only the individual can think, and thereby create new values for society — nay, even set up new moral standards to which the life of the community conforms. Without creative, independently thinking and judging personalities the upward development of society is as unthinkable as the development of the individual personality without the nourishing soil of the community.<br />

<li>Freedom is the very essence of life, the impelling force in all intellectual and social development, the creator of every new outlook for the future of mankind.

<li>Very many maintain that all we know is still infinitely less than all that still remains unknown; nor do philosophers pin their faith to others' precepts in such wise that they lose their liberty, and cease to give credence to the conclusions of their proper senses.

<li>The first peace, which is the most important, is that which comes within the souls of people when they realize their relationship, their oneness, with the universe and all its powers, and when they realize that at the center of the universe dwells <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakan_Tanka" class="extiw" title="w:Wakan Tanka">Wakan-Tanka</a></i>, and that this center is really everywhere, it is within each of us. This is the real peace, and the others are but reflections of this. The second peace is that which is made between two individuals, and the third is that which is made between two nations. But above all you should understand that there can never be peace between nations until there is known that true peace, which, as I have often said, is within the souls of men. ~ <a href="/wiki/Black_Elk" title="Black Elk">Black Elk</a></li>

The vicious are the willing, and the ignorant are unconscious instruments of political artifice. Selfishness and demagoguery take advantage of liberty. The selfish hand constantly seeks to control government, and every increase of governmental power, even to meet just needs, furnishes opportunity for abuse and stimulates the effort to bend it to improper uses. ..

<li>I believe that music can be an inspirational force in all our lives — that its eloquence and the depth of its meaning are all-important, and that all personal considerations concerning musicians and the public are relatively unimportant — that music come from the heart and returns to the heart — that music is spontaneous, impulsive expression — that its range is without limit — that music is forever growing — that music can be one element to help us build a new conception of life in which the madness and cruelty of wars will be replaced by a simple understanding of the brotherhood of man. ~ <a href="/wiki/Leopold_Stokowski" title="Leopold Stokowski">Leopold Stokowski</a></li>

<li>We live in a world ruled by fictions of every kind — mass merchandising, advertising, politics conducted as a branch of advertising, the instant translation of science and technology into popular imagery, the increasing blurring and intermingling of identities within the realm of consumer goods, the preempting of any free or original imaginative response to experience by the television screen.

<li>Beneficence is godlike, and he who does most good to his fellow-man is the Master of Masters, and has learned the Art of Arts. Enrich and embellish the universe as you will, it is only a fit temple for the heart that loves truth with a supreme love. Inanimate vastness excites wonder; knowledge kindles admiration, but love enraptures the soul. Scientific truth is marvellous, but moral truth is divine; and whoever breathes its air and walks by its light, has found the lost paradise. For him, a new heaven and a new earth have already been created. His home is the sanctuary of God, the Holy of Holies. ~ <a href="/wiki/Horace_Mann" title="Horace Mann">Horace Mann</a></li>
<li>Is it an excellence in your love that it can love only the extraordinary, the rare? If it were love’s merit to love the extraordinary, then God would be — if I dare say so — perplexed, for to Him the extraordinary does not exist at all. The merit of being able to love only the extraordinary is therefore more like an accusation, not against the extraordinary nor against love, but against the love which can love only the extraordinary. Perfection in the object is not perfection in the love. Erotic love is determined by the object; friendship is determined by the object; only love of one’s neighbor is determined by love. Therefore genuine love is recognizable by this, that its object is without any of the more definite qualifications of difference, which means that this love is recognizable only by love. ~ <a href="/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard" title="Søren Kierkegaard">Søren Kierkegaard</a></li>

<li>The slave system is one of constant danger, distrust, suspicion, and watchfulness. It debases those whose toil alone can produce wealth and resources for defence, to the lowest degree of which human nature is capable, to guard against mutiny and insurrection, and thus wastes energies which otherwise might be employed in national development and aggrandizement. The free-labor system educates all alike, and by opening all the fields of industrial employment and all the departments of authority, to the unchecked and equal rivalry of all classes of men, at once secures universal contentment, and brings into the highest possible activity all the physical, moral, and social energies of the whole state. ~ <a href="/wiki/William_H._Seward" title="William H.

<li>You will hear every day the maxims of a low prudence. You will hear, that the first duty is to get land and money, place and name. "What is this Truth you seek? What is this Beauty?" men will ask, with derision. If, nevertheless, God have called any of you to explore truth and beauty, be bold, be firm, be true. When you shall say, "As others do, so will I. I renounce, I am sorry for it, my early visions; I must eat the good of the land, and let learning and romantic expectations go, until a more convenient season." — then dies the man in you; then once more perish the buds of art, and poetry, and science, as they have died already in a thousand thousand men. The hour of that choice is the crisis of your history; and see that you hold yourself fast by the intellect. ...

<li>I recall an old Sufi story of a good man who was granted one wish by God. The man said he would like to go about doing good without knowing about it. God granted his wish. And then God decided that it was such a good idea, he would grant that wish to all human beings.<br />

<li>My knowledge of pain, learned with the sabre, taught me not to be afraid. And just as in dueling when you must concentrate on your enemy's cheek, so, too, in war.

<li>The Zen disciple sits for long hours silent and motionless, with his eyes closed. Presently he enters a state of impassivity, free from all ideas and all thoughts. He departs from the self and enters the realm of nothingness. This is not the nothingness or the emptiness of the West. It is rather the reverse, a universe of the spirit in which everything communicates freely with everything, transcending bounds, limitless. ... The disciple must, however, always be lord of his own thoughts, and must attain enlightenment through his own efforts. And the emphasis is less upon reason and argument than upon intuition, immediate feeling. Enlightenment comes not from teaching but through the eye awakened inwardly. Truth is in "the discarding of words", it lies "outside words".<br />

<li>Whether one believes in evolution, intelligent design, or Divine Creation, one thing is certain. Since the beginning of history, human beings have been at war with each other, under the pretext of religion, ideology, ethnicity and other reasons. And no civilization has ever willingly given up its most powerful weapons.

<li>The history of a battle, is not unlike the history of a ball.

<li>The wellspring of courage and endurance in the face of unbridled power is generally a firm belief in the sanctity of ethical principles combined with a historical sense that despite all setbacks the condition of man is set on an ultimate course for both spiritual and material advancement. At the root of human responsibility is the concept of perfection, the urge to achieve it, the intelligence to find a path towards it, and the will to follow that path if not to the end at least the distance needed to rise above individual limitations and environmental impediments. It is man's vision of a world fit for rational, civilized humanity which leads him to dare and to suffer to build societies free from want and fear. Concepts such as truth, justice and compassion cannot be dismissed as trite when these are often the only bulwarks which stand against ruthless power. ~ <a href="/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi" title="Aung San Suu Kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a></li>

<li>There was sadness in being a man, but it was a proud thing too. And he showed what the pride of it was till you couldn't help feeling it. Yes, even in hell, if a man was a man, you'd know it. And he wasn't pleading for any one person any more, though his voice rang like an organ. He was telling the story and the failures and the endless journey of mankind. They got tricked and trapped and bamboozled, but it was a great journey. And no demon that was ever foaled could know the inwardness of it — it took a man to do that. ... His voice could search the heart, and that was his gift and his strength. And to one, his voice was like the forest and its secrecy, and to another like the sea and the storms of the sea; and one heard the cry of his lost nation in it, and another saw a little harmless scene he hadn't remembered for years. But each saw something. And when Dan'l Webster finished he didn't know whether or not he'd saved Jabez Stone. But he knew he'd done a miracle. For the glitter was gone from the eyes of the judge and jury, and, for the moment, they were men again, and knew they were men. ~ <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Vincent_Ben%C3%A9t" title="Stephen Vincent Benét">Stephen Vincent Benét</a></li>
<li>The preservation of peace and the guaranteeing of man's basic freedoms and rights require courage and eternal vigilance: courage to speak and act — and if necessary, to suffer and die — for truth and justice; eternal vigilance, that the least transgression of international morality shall not go undetected and unremedied.

<li>Monsters remain human beings.

And that the power and strength of diversity, the ability of people from everywhere ... whether they're black or white, whether they're Japanese-Americans or Korean-Americans or Filipino-Americans or whatever they are, they are just Americans, that all of us can work together and all of us can join together to create a better country.

<li>What is the use of being wise if we are not sometimes merry? The merriment of wise men is not the uninformed, gross fun of ignorant men, but it has more kinship with that than the pinched, frightened fun of those who are neither learned nor ignorant, gentle nor simple, bound nor free. The idea that a wise man must be solemn is bred and preserved among people who have no idea what wisdom is, and can only respect whatever makes them feel inferior. ~ <a href="/wiki/Robertson_Davies" title="Robertson Davies">Robertson Davies</a></li>
<li>Consciousness expresses itself through creation. This world we live in is the dance of the Creator. Dancers come and go in the twinkling of an eye but the dance lives on. On many an occasion when I am dancing, I have felt touched by something sacred. In those moments, I felt my spirit soar and become one with everything that exists. I become the stars and the moon. I become the lover and the beloved. I become the victor and the vanquished. I become the master and the slave. I become the singer and the song. I become the knower and the known. I keep on dancing and then, it is the eternal dance of creation. The Creator and the creation merge into one wholeness of joy. I keep on dancing — until there is only ... the dance. ~ <a href="/wiki/Michael_Jackson" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a></li>
<li>The animals of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgess_Shale" class="extiw" title="w:Burgess Shale">Burgess Shale</a> are holy objects — in the unconventional sense that this word conveys in some cultures. We do not place them on pedestals and worship from afar. We climb mountains and dynamite hillsides to find them. We quarry them, split them, carve them, draw them, and dissect them, struggling to wrest their secrets. We vilify and curse them for their damnable intransigence. They are grubby little creatures of a sea floor 530 million years old, but we greet them with awe because they are the Old Ones, and they are trying to tell us something. ~ <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould" title="Stephen Jay Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a></li>
<li>There's not a war between Muslims and non-Muslims, but between extremists and moderates of all the religions. ... What is important is not to live in fear.

<li>If thinking men are few, they are for that reason all the more powerful. Let no man imagine that he has no influence. Whoever he may be, and wherever he may be placed, the man who thinks becomes a light and a power. ~ <a href="/wiki/Henry_George" title="Henry George">Henry George</a></li>
<li>Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, <i>form ever follows function</i>, and this is the law. Where function does not change form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever brooding hills, remain for ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies in a twinkling.<br />
It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the life is recognizable in its expression, that form ever follows function. <i>This is the law.</i> ~ <a href="/wiki/Louis_Sullivan" title="Louis Sullivan">Louis Sullivan</a></li>

I look back on my life like a good day's work, it was done and I am satisfied with it. I was happy and contented, I knew nothing better and made the best out of what life offered.

<li>All men live not by the thought they spend on their own welfare, but because love exists in man.<br />
I knew before that God gave life to men and desires that they should live; now I understood more than that.<br />
I understood that God does not wish men to live apart, and therefore he does not reveal to them what each one needs for himself; but he wishes them to live united, and therefore reveals to each of them what is necessary for all.<br />
I have now understood that though it seems to men that they live by care for themselves, in truth it is love alone by which they live. He who has love, is in God, and God is in him, for God is love. ~ <a href="/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a></li>
<li>It is the man of science, eager to have his every opinion regenerated, his every idea rationalized, by drinking at the fountain of fact, and devoting all the energies of his life to the cult of truth, not as he understands it, but as he does not yet understand it, that ought properly to be called a philosopher. ~ <a href="/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce" title="Charles Sanders Peirce">Charles Sanders Peirce</a></li>
<li>On September 11, 2001, the world fractured. It's beyond my skill as a writer to capture that day, and the days that would follow — the planes, like specters, vanishing into steel and glass; the slow-motion cascade of the towers crumbling into themselves; the ash-covered figures wandering the streets; the anguish and the fear. Nor do I pretend to understand the stark nihilism that drove the terrorists that day and that drives their brethren still.

<li>In an ideal University, as I conceive it, a man should be able to obtain instruction in all forms of knowledge, and discipline in the use of all the methods by which knowledge is obtained. In such a University, the force of living example should fire the student with a noble ambition to emulate the learning of learned men, and to follow in the footsteps of the explorers of new fields of knowledge. And the very air he breathes should be charged with that enthusiasm for truth, that fanaticism of veracity, which is a greater possession than much learning; a nobler gift than the power of increasing knowledge; by so much greater and nobler than these, as the moral nature of man is greater than the intellectual; for veracity is the heart of morality. ~ <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley" title="Thomas Henry Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a></li>
<li>Extremism. It is an almost infallible sign — a kind of death-rattle — when a human institution is forced by its members into stressing those and <i>only</i> those factors which are identificatory, at the expense of others which it necessarily shares with competing institutions because human beings belong to all of them. ~ <a href="/wiki/John_Brunner" title="John Brunner">John Brunner</a></li>
<li>The aim of every artist is to arrest motion, which is life, by artificial means and hold it fixed so that a hundred years later, when a stranger looks at it, it moves again since it is life.

This is the artist's way of scribbling "<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilroy_was_here" class="extiw" title="w:Kilroy was here">Kilroy was here</a>" on the wall of the final and irrevocable oblivion through which he must someday pass. ~ <a href="/wiki/William_Faulkner" title="William Faulkner">William Faulkner</a></li>

<li>The liberties of our Country, the freedom of our civil constitution are worth defending at all hazards: And it is our duty to defend them against all attacks. We have receiv'd them as a fair Inheritance from our worthy Ancestors: They purchas'd them for us with toil and danger and expence of treasure and blood; and transmitted them to us with care and diligence. It will bring an everlasting mark of infamy on the present generation, enlightened as it is, if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by violence without a struggle; or be cheated out of them by the artifices of false and designing men. Of the latter we are in most danger at present: Let us therefore be aware of it. Let us contemplate our forefathers and posterity; and resolve to maintain the rights bequeath'd to us from the former, for the sake of the latter. — Instead of sitting down satisfied with the efforts we have already made, which is the wish of our enemies, the necessity of the times, more than ever, calls for our utmost circumspection, deliberation, fortitude, and perseverance. ~ <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Adams" title="Samuel Adams">Samuel Adams</a></li>
<li>The way which the superior man pursues, reaches wide and far, and yet is secret. Common men and women, however ignorant, may intermeddle with the knowledge of it; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage does not know. Common men and women, however much below the ordinary standard of character, can carry it into practice; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into practice. Great as heaven and earth are, men still find some things in them with which to be dissatisfied. Thus it is that, were the superior man to speak of his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world would be found able to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its minuteness, nothing in the world would be found able to split it. ~ <a href="/wiki/Confucius" title="Confucius">Confucius</a></li>

<li>The real difficulty is with the vast wealth and power in the hands of the few and the unscrupulous who represent or control capital.

<li>Once the curtain is raised, the actor ceases to belong to himself. He belongs to his character, to his author, to his public. He must do the impossible to identify himself with the first, not to betray the second, and not to disappoint the third. And to this end the actor must forget his personality and throw aside his joys and sorrows. He must present the public with the reality of a being who for him is only a fiction. With his own eyes, he must shed the tears of the other. With his own voice, he must groan the anguish of the other. His own heart beats as if it would burst, for it is the other's heart that beats in his heart.

<li>The science of government it is my duty to study, more than all other sciences; the arts of legislation and administration and negotiation ought to take the place of, indeed exclude, in a manner, all other arts.

<li>Athirst for personal salvation, the West forgets that many religions had but a vague notion of the life beyond the grave; true, all great religions stake a claim on eternity, but not necessarily on man's eternal life. ~ <a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Malraux" title="André Malraux">André Malraux</a></li>

<li>Years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind then that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth.

<li>Call me Ishmael.

<li>What I say is, that the real non-resistants can believe in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action" class="extiw" title="w:Direct action">direct action</a> only, never in political action.

<li>Although I came to doubt all revelation, I can never accept the idea that the Universe is a physical or chemical accident, a result of blind evolution. Even though I learned to recognize the lies, the clichés and the idolatries of the human mind, I still cling to some truths which I think all of us might accept some day. There must be a way for man to attain all possible pleasures, all the powers and knowledge that nature can grant him, and still serve God — a God who speaks in deeds, not in words, and whose vocabulary is the Cosmos. ~ <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Bashevis_Singer" title="Isaac Bashevis Singer">Isaac Bashevis Singer</a></li>

<li>I believe that what separates us all from one another is simply society itself, or, if you like, politics. This is what raises barriers between men, this is what creates misunderstanding.<br />
If I may be allowed to express myself paradoxically, I should say that the truest society, the authentic human community, is extra-social — a wider, deeper society, that which is revealed by our common anxieties, our desires, our secret nostalgias. The whole history of the world has been governed by nostalgias and anxieties, which political action does no more than reflect and interpret, very imperfectly. No society has been able to abolish human sadness, no political system can deliver us from the pain of living, from our fear of death, our thirst for the absolute. It is the human condition that directs the social condition, not vice versa. ~ <a href="/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Ionesco" title="Eugène Ionesco">Eugène Ionesco</a></li>
<li><i>Flow in the living moment.</i> — We are always in a process of becoming and NOTHING is fixed. Have no rigid system in you, and you'll be flexible to change with the ever changing. OPEN yourelf and flow, my friend. Flow in the TOTAL OPENESS OF THE LIVING MOMENT. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Moving, be like water. Still, be like a mirror. Respond like an echo. ~ <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Lee" title="Bruce Lee">Bruce Lee</a></li>
<li>Enthusiastic partisans of the idea of progress are in danger of failing to recognize — because they set so little store by them — the immense riches accumulated by the human race on either side of the narrow furrow on which they keep their eyes fixed; by underrating the achievements of the past, they devalue all those which still remain to be accomplished. ~ <a href="/wiki/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss" title="Claude Lévi-Strauss">Claude Lévi-Strauss</a></li>

<li>I do think that if I had to choose one word to which hope can be tied it is <i>hospitality</i>.

<li>A different conception of society, very different from that which now prevails, is in process of formation. ... Acknowledging, as a fact, the equal rights of all its members to the treasures accumulated in the past ... it seeks to establish a certain harmonious compatibility in its midst — not by subjecting all its members to an authority that is fictitiously supposed to represent society, not by trying to establish uniformity, but by urging all men to develop free initiative, free action, free association. ~ <a href="/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a></li>
<li>We despise and abhor the bully, the brawler, the oppressor, whether in private or public life, but we despise no less the coward and the voluptuary. No man is worth calling a man who will not fight rather than submit to infamy or see those that are dear to him suffer wrong. ~ <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a></li>
<li>If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them.

<li>What is beautiful is moral, that is all there is to it. ~ <a href="/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert" title="Gustave Flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a></li>
<li>Pedantry and mastery are opposite attitudes toward rules. To apply a rule to the letter, rigidly, unquestioningly, in cases where it fits and in cases where it does not fit, is pedantry... To apply a rule with natural ease, with judgment, noticing the cases where it fits, and without ever letting the words of the rule obscure the purpose of the action or the opportunities of the situation, is mastery. ~ <a href="/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya" title="George Pólya">George Pólya</a></li>
<li>Moral cowardice that keeps us from speaking our minds is as dangerous to this country as irresponsible talk. The right way is not always the popular and easy way.

<li>All of us encounter, at least once in our life, some individual who utters words that make us think forever.

<li>"Heaven helps those who help themselves" is a well-tried maxim, embodying in a small compass the results of vast human experience. The spirit of self-help is the root of all genuine growth in the individual; and, exhibited in the lives of many, it constitutes the true source of national vigour and strength. Help from without is often enfeebling in its effects, but help from within invariably invigorates. Whatever is done for men or classes, to a certain extent takes away the stimulus and necessity of doing for themselves; and where men are subjected to over-guidance and over-government, the inevitable tendency is to render them comparatively helpless. ~ <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Smiles" title="Samuel Smiles">Samuel Smiles</a></li>

<li>The obstacles to peace are in the minds and hearts of men.<br />
In the study of matter we can be honest, impartial, true. That is why we succeed in dealing with it. But about the things we care for — which are ourselves, our desires and lusts, our patriotisms and hates — we find a harder test of thinking straight and truly. Yet there is the greater need. Only by intellectual rectitude and in that field shall we be saved. There is no refuge but in truth, in human intelligence, in the unconquerable mind of man. ~ <a href="/wiki/Norman_Angell" title="Norman Angell">Norman Angell</a></li>

To this one can reply "What use is the Acropolis?" Does a creature have to be of direct material use to mankind in order to exist?

<li>A religious education is an education which inculcates duty and reverence. Duty arises from our potential control over the course of events. Where attainable knowledge could have changed the issue, ignorance has the guilt of vice.

<li>People have such terrible assumptions about ghosts — you know, phantoms that haunt you, that make you scared, that turn the house upside down. Yin people are not in our living presence but are around, and kind of guide you to insights. Like in Las Vegas when the bells go off, telling you you've hit the jackpot. Yin people ring the bells, saying, "Pay attention." And you say, "Oh, I see now." Yet I'm a fairly skeptical person. I'm educated, I'm reasonably sane, and I know that this subject is fodder for ridicule. ... To write the book, I had to put that aside. As with any book. I go through the anxiety, "What will people think of me for writing something like this?"

<li>It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes. Distinctions in society will always exist under every just government. Equality of talents, of education, or of wealth can not be produced by human institutions. In the full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry, economy, and virtue, every man is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society — the farmers, mechanics, and laborers — who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their government. ~ <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a></li>

Our first duty is at home with our own opinion, by education and unceasing effort to bring to naught the mischievous exhortation of chauvinists; our next is to aid in every practicable way in promoting a better feeling among peoples, the healing of wounds, and the just settlement of differences. ~ <a href="/wiki/Charles_Evans_Hughes" title="Charles Evans Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a></li>

<li>History says don't hope<br />
On this side of the grave.<br />
But then, once in a lifetime<br />

And hope and history rhyme.<br />
So hope for a great sea-change<br />
on the far side of revenge.<br />
Believe that a further shore<br />
is reachable from here.<br />
Believe in miracles<br />
and cures and healing wells.

<li>I have read that the secret of gallantry is to accept the pleasures of life leisurely, and its inconveniences with a shrug; as well as that, among other requisites, the gallant person will always consider the world with a smile of toleration, and his own doings with a smile of honest amusement, and Heaven with a smile which is not distrustful — being thoroughly persuaded that God is kindlier than the genteel would regard as rational. ~ <a href="/wiki/James_Branch_Cabell" title="James Branch Cabell">James Branch Cabell</a></li>

<li>The impartiality which, in contemplation, is the unalloyed desire for truth, is the very same quality of mind which, in action, is justice, and in emotion is that universal love which can be given to all, and not only to those who are judged useful or admirable. Thus contemplation not only enlarges the objects of our thoughts, but also the objects of our actions and our affections: it makes us citizens of the universe, not only of one walled city at war with the rest.

<li>The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.

<li>There is a legend about a bird that sings just once in its life, more sweetly than any other creature on the face of the earth. From the moment it leaves the nest it searches for a thorn tree and does not rest until it has found one. Then, singing among the savage branches, it impales itself upon the longest, sharpest spine. Dying, it rises above its own agony to out-carol the lark and the nightingale. One superlative song, existence the price. But the whole world stills to listen, and God in His heaven smiles. For the best is only bought at the cost of the great pain. … Or so says the legend. ~ <a href="/wiki/Colleen_McCullough" title="Colleen McCullough">Colleen McCullough</a></li>

<li>A person reveals his character by nothing so clearly as the joke he resents. ~ <a href="/wiki/Georg_Christoph_Lichtenberg" title="Georg Christoph Lichtenberg">Georg Christoph Lichtenberg</a></li>
<li>Inspiration is not the exclusive privilege of poets or artists. There is, there has been, there will always be a certain group of people whom inspiration visits. It's made up of all those who've consciously chosen their calling and do their job with love and imagination. It may include doctors, teachers, gardeners — I could list a hundred more professions. Their work becomes one continuous adventure as long as they manage to keep discovering new challenges in it. Difficulties and setbacks never quell their curiosity. A swarm of new questions emerges from every problem that they solve. Whatever inspiration is, it's born from a continuous "I don't know." ~ <a href="/wiki/Wis%C5%82awa_Szymborska" title="Wisława Szymborska">Wisława Szymborska</a></li>
<li>I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all. No... not the artful postures of love, not playful and poetical games of love for the amusement of an evening, but love that... overthrows life. Unbiddable, ungovernable — like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love — like there has never been in a play. ~ <a href="/wiki/Tom_Stoppard" title="Tom Stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Shakespeare_in_Love" title="Shakespeare in Love">Shakespeare in Love</a></i></li>
<li>The greatest obstacle to being heroic is the doubt whether one may not be going to prove one's self a fool; the truest heroism is, to resist the doubt; and the profoundest wisdom, to know when it ought to be resisted, and when to be obeyed. ~ <a href="/wiki/Nathaniel_Hawthorne" title="Nathaniel Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a></li>
<li>Life is not theory. It is reality, with inherent duties to everything and everyone. ~ <a href="/wiki/Tivadar_Csontv%C3%A1ry_Kosztka" title="Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka">Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka</a></li>
<li>I believe that at every level of society — familial, tribal, national and international — the key to a happier and more successful world is the growth of compassion. We do not need to become religious, nor do we need to believe in an ideology. All that is necessary is for each of us to develop our good human qualities. ~ <a href="/wiki/Tenzin_Gyatso,_14th_Dalai_Lama" title="Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama">Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama</a></li>
<li>I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do. ~ <a href="/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein" title="Robert A. Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress" title="The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a></i></li>
<li>There must be understanding between the artist and the people. In the best ages of art that has always been the case. Genius can probably run on ahead and seek out new ways. But the good artists who follow after genius — and I count myself among these — have to restore the lost connection once more. ~ <a href="/wiki/K%C3%A4the_Kollwitz" title="Käthe Kollwitz">Käthe Kollwitz</a></li>
<li>We have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties? ~ <a href="/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a></li>
<li>Universal peace as a result of cumulative effort through centuries past might come into existence quickly — not unlike a crystal that suddenly forms in a solution which has been slowly prepared. ~ <a href="/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" title="Nikola Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a></li>
<li>Life's meaning has always eluded me and I guess it always will. But I love it just the same. ~ <a href="/wiki/E._B._White" title="E. B. White">E. B. White</a></li>
<li>No human being is constituted to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; and even the best of men must be content with fragments, with partial glimpses, never the full fruition. ~ <a href="/wiki/William_Osler" title="William Osler">William Osler</a></li>
<li>It is lack of confidence, more than anything else, that kills a civilisation. We can destroy ourselves by cynicism and disillusion, just as effectively as by bombs. ~ <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Clark" title="Kenneth Clark">Kenneth Clark</a></li>
<li>Freedom is not an exchange — it is freedom. ~ <a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Malraux" title="André Malraux">André Malraux</a></li>
<li>There is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism. ~ <a href="/wiki/Walter_Benjamin" title="Walter Benjamin">Walter Benjamin</a></li>
<li>Nothing limits intelligence more than ignorance; nothing fosters ignorance more than one's own opinions; nothing strengthens opinions more than refusing to look at reality. ~ <a href="/wiki/Sheri_S._Tepper" title="Sheri S. Tepper">Sheri S. Tepper</a></li>
<li><i>God, from a beautiful necessity, is Love in all he doeth,<br />
Love, a brilliant fire, to gladden or consume:<br />
The wicked work their woe by looking upon love, and hating it:<br />
The righteous find their joys in yearning on its loveliness for ever. ~ <a href="/wiki/Martin_Farquhar_Tupper" title="Martin Farquhar Tupper">Martin Farquhar Tupper</a></i></li>
<li>A man who takes away another man's freedom is a prisoner of hatred, he is locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrow-mindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away someone else's freedom, just as surely as I am not free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity.<br />
When I walked out of prison, that was my mission, to liberate the oppressed and the oppressor both. Some say that has now been achieved. But I know that that is not the case. The truth is that we are not yet free; we have merely achieved the freedom to be free, the right not to be oppressed. We have not taken the final step of our journey, but the first step on a longer and even more difficult road. For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. The true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning. ~ <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a></li>
<li>I should like to be famous and unknown. ~ <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Degas" title="Edgar Degas">Edgar Degas</a></li>
<li>Hitherto your eyes have been darkened and you have looked too much, yes, far too much, upon the things of earth. If these so much delight you what shall be your rapture when you lift your gaze to things eternal! ~ <a href="/wiki/Petrarch" title="Petrarch">Petrarch</a></li>
<li>Today is only one day in all the days that will ever be. But what will happen in all the other days that ever come can depend on what you do today. It's been that way all this year. It's been that way so many times. All of war is that way. ~ <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a></li>
<li><i>There was no pain when I awoke,<br />
No pain at all. Rest, like a goad,<br />
Spurred my eyes open — and light broke<br />
Upon them like a million swords:<br />
And she was there. There are no words.<br />
Heaven is for a moment's span.<br />
And ever.</i> ~ <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Vincent_Ben%C3%A9t" title="Stephen Vincent Benét">Stephen Vincent Benét</a></li>
<li>There are two kinds of truth: the truth that lights the way and the truth that warms the heart. The first of these is science, and the second is art. Neither is independent of the other or more important than the other. Without art science would be as useless as a pair of high forceps in the hands of a plumber. Without science art would become a crude mess of folklore and emotional quackery. The truth of art keeps science from becoming inhuman, and the truth of science keeps art from becoming ridiculous. ~ <a href="/wiki/Raymond_Chandler" title="Raymond Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a></li>
<li>The three greatest fools of history have been Jesus Christ, Don Quixote . . . and me! ~ <a href="/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar" title="Simón Bolívar">Simón Bolívar</a></li>
<li>The central task of education is to implant a will and a facility for learning; it should produce not learned but learning people. The truly human society is a learning society, where grandparents, parents, and children are students together.<br />
In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists. ~ <a href="/wiki/Eric_Hoffer" title="Eric Hoffer">Eric Hoffer</a></li>
<li>We are so captivated by and entangled in our subjective consciousness that we have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions. ~ <a href="/wiki/Carl_Jung" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a></li>
<li>I've been sleeping through my life<br />
Now I'm waking up<br />
And I want to stand in the sunshine<br />
I have never been ecstatic<br />
Had a flower but it never bloomed<br />
In the darkness of my wasted youth<br />
It was hiding in the shadows<br />
Learning to become invisible<br />
Uncover me.<br />

Thy Spirit animates eternal years,<br />

<li>Only a crisis — actual or perceived — produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable. ~ <a href="/wiki/Milton_Friedman" title="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a></li>

<ol>
<li>It is — or seems to be — a wise sort of thing, to realise that all that happens to a man in this life is only by way of joke, especially his misfortunes, if he have them. And it is also worth bearing in mind, that the joke is passed round pretty liberally &amp; impartially, so that not very many are entitled to fancy that they in particular are getting the worst of it. ~ <a href="/wiki/Herman_Melville" title="Herman Melville">Herman Melville</a></li>
<li>One writes out of one thing only — one's own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give. This is the only real concern of the artist, to recreate out of the disorder of life that order which is art. ~ <a href="/wiki/James_Baldwin" title="James Baldwin">James Baldwin</a></li>
<li>Perhaps there was no limit, there might, quite likely, be no such condition as the ultimate; there might be no time when any creature or any group of creatures could stop at any certain point and say, this is as far as we can go, there is no use of trying to go farther. For each new development produced, as side effects, so many other possibilities, so many other roads to travel, that with each step one took down any given road there were more paths to follow. There'd never be an end, he thought — no end to anything. ~ <a href="/wiki/Clifford_D._Simak" title="Clifford D. Simak">Clifford D. Simak</a></li>
<li>Contrary to the rumours that you've heard, I was not born in a manger. I was actually born on Krypton and sent here by my father, Jor-El, to save the planet Earth. ~ <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a></li>

<li><i>Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new:<br />
That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do:</i>
<p><i>For I dipped into the future, far as human eye could see,<br />
Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;</i></p>
<p><i>Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,<br />

<p><i>Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew<br />
From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;</i></p>

<li>If you are not ready, and did not know what to do, it could hurt you in different ways. It could knock you down, hard, or throw you against a tree or a wall. It is such a big explosion, it can smash in buildings and knock signboards over, and break windows all over town, but if you duck and cover, like Bert, you will be much safer. ~ <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_and_Cover" class="extiw" title="w:Duck and Cover">Duck and Cover</a></li>
<li>The one thing we know about torture is that it was never designed in the first place to get at the actual truth of anything; it was designed in the darkest days of human history to produce false confessions in order to annihilate political and religious dissidents.

<li>The ironist is not bitter, he does not seek to undercut everything that seems worthy or serious, he scorns the cheap scoring-off of the wisecracker. He stands, so to speak, somewhat at one side, observes and speaks with a moderation which is occasionally embellished with a flash of controlled exaggeration. He speaks from a certain depth, and thus he is not of the same nature as the wit, who so often speaks from the tongue and no deeper. The wit's desire is to be funny; the ironist is only funny as a secondary achievement. ~ <a href="/wiki/Robertson_Davies" title="Robertson Davies">Robertson Davies</a></li>
<li>Poets are never young, in one sense.

<li>One thing only is needful: the knowledge of the simple and clear truth which finds place in every soul that is not stupefied by religious and scientific superstitions — the truth that for our life one law is valid — the law of love, which brings the highest happiness to every individual as well as to all mankind. Free your minds from those overgrown, mountainous imbecilities which hinder your recognition of it, and at once the truth will emerge from amid the pseudo-religious nonsense that has been smothering it: the indubitable, eternal truth inherent in man, which is one and the same in all the great religions of the world.

<li>We have entered the third millennium through a gate of fire. If today, after the horror of 11 September, we see better, and we see further — we will realize that humanity is indivisible. New threats make no distinction between races, nations or regions. A new insecurity has entered every mind, regardless of wealth or status. A deeper awareness of the bonds that bind us all — in pain as in prosperity — has gripped young and old. In the early beginnings of the 21st century — a century already violently disabused of any hopes that progress towards global peace and prosperity is inevitable — this new reality can no longer be ignored.

<li>The most important things are the hardest things to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them — words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they're brought out. But it's more than that, isn't it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That's the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller, but for want of an understanding ear. ~ <a href="/wiki/Stephen_King" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a></li>
<li>I have far more confidence in the one man who works mentally and bodily at a matter than in the six who merely talk about it … Nature is our kindest friend and best critic in experimental science if we only allow her intimations to fall unbiased on our minds. Nothing is so good as an experiment which, whilst it sets an error right, gives us (as a reward for our humility in being reproved) an absolute advancement in knowledge. ~ <a href="/wiki/Michael_Faraday" title="Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a></li>
<li>The improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority, as such. For him, scepticism is the highest of duties; blind faith the one unpardonable sin. And it cannot be otherwise, for every great advance in natural knowledge has involved the absolute rejection of authority, the cherishing of the keenest scepticism, the annihilation of the spirit of blind faith; and the most ardent votary of science holds his firmest convictions, not because the men he most venerates hold them; not because their verity is testified by portents and wonders; but because his experience teaches him that whenever he chooses to bring these convictions into contact with their primary source, Nature — whenever he thinks fit to test them by appealing to experiment and to observation — Nature will confirm them. The man of science has learned to believe in justification, not by faith, but by verification. ~ <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley" title="Thomas Henry Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a></li>
<li>Once one is caught up into the material world not one person in ten thousand finds the time to form literary taste, to examine the validity of philosophic concepts for himself, or to form what, for lack of a better phrase, I might call the wise and tragic sense of life. ~ <a href="/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald" title="F.

<li>No one is without Christianity, if we agree on what we mean by that word. It is every individual’s individual code of behavior by means of which he makes himself a better human being than his nature wants to be, if he followed his nature only.

<li><i>At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;<br />
Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,<br />
But neither arrest nor movement.<br />
And do not call it fixity,<br />
Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,<br />
Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,<br />
There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.<br />
I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where<br />
And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.</i>

<li>It is the way of the superior man to prefer the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more illustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of the superior man, appearing insipid, yet never to produce satiety; while showing a simple negligence, yet to have his accomplishments recognized; while seemingly plain, yet to be discriminating. He knows how what is distant lies in what is near. He knows where the wind proceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes manifested.

<li>The truth is that my work — I was going to say my mission — is to shatter the faith of men here, there, and everywhere, faith in affirmation, faith in negation, and faith in abstention in faith, and this for the sake of faith in faith itself; it is to war against all those who submit, whether it be to Catholicism, or to rationalism, or to agnosticism; it is to make all men live the life of inquietude and passionate desire. ~ <a href="/wiki/Miguel_de_Unamuno" title="Miguel de Unamuno">Miguel de Unamuno</a></li>

<li>The only real hope of people today is probably a renewal of our certainty that we are rooted in the earth and, at the same time, in the cosmos. This awareness endows us with the capacity for self-transcendence. Politicians at international forums may reiterate a thousand times that the basis of the new world order must be universal respect for human rights, but it will mean nothing as long as this imperative does not derive from the respect of the miracle of Being, the miracle of the universe, the miracle of nature, the miracle of our own existence.

<li>In every civilization, however generally prosaic, however addicted to the short-time point of view on human affairs, there are always certain alien spirits who, while outwardly conforming to the requirements of the civilization around them, still keep a disinterested regard for the plain intelligible law of things, irrespective of any practical end. They have an intellectual curiosity, sometimes touched with emotion, concerning the august order of nature; they are impressed by the contemplation of it, and like to know as much about it as they can, even in circumstances where its operation is ever so manifestly unfavourable to their best hopes and wishes. ~ <a href="/wiki/Albert_Jay_Nock" title="Albert Jay Nock">Albert Jay Nock</a></li>
<li>We must be ready to dare all for our country. For history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid.

<li>When the modern corporation acquires power over markets, power in the community, power over the state and power over belief, it is a political instrument, different in degree but not in kind from the state itself. To hold otherwise — to deny the political character of the modern corporation — is not merely to avoid the reality. It is to disguise the reality. The victims of that disguise are the students who instruct in error. Let there be no question: economics, so long as it is thus taught, becomes, however unconsciously, a part of the arrangement by which the citizen or student is kept from seeing how he or she is, or will be, governed. ~ <a href="/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith" title="John Kenneth Galbraith">John Kenneth Galbraith</a></li>

<li>If we must all agree, all work together, we're no better than a machine. If an individual can't work in solidarity with his fellows, it's his duty to work alone. His duty and his right. We have been denying people that right. We've been saying, more and more often, you must work with the others, you must accept the rule of the majority. But any rule is tyranny. The duty of the individual is to accept no rule, to be the initiator of his own acts, to be responsible. Only if he does so will the society live, and change, and adapt, and survive. We are not subjects of a State founded upon law, but members of a society founded upon revolution.

<li>I have seen the truth; I have seen and I know that people can be beautiful and happy without losing the power of living on earth. I will not and cannot believe that evil is the normal condition of mankind. And it is just this faith of mine that they laugh at. But how can I help believing it? I have seen the truth — it is not as though I had invented it with my mind, I have seen it, seen it, and the living image of it has filled my soul for ever. I have seen it in such full perfection that I cannot believe that it is impossible for people to have it. And so how can I go wrong? I shall make some slips no doubt, and shall perhaps talk in second-hand language, but not for long: the living image of what I saw will always be with me and will always correct and guide me. Oh, I am full of courage and freshness, and I will go on and on if it were for a thousand years! Do you know, at first I meant to conceal the fact that I corrupted them, but that was a mistake — that was my first mistake! But truth whispered to me that I was lying, and preserved me and corrected me. But how establish paradise — I don't know, because I do not know how to put it into words. After my dream I lost command of words. All the chief words, anyway, the most necessary ones. But never mind, I shall go and I shall keep talking, I won't leave off, for anyway I have seen it with my own eyes, though I cannot describe what I saw. But the scoffers do not understand that. It was a dream, they say, delirium, hallucination. Oh! As though that meant so much! And they are so proud! A dream! What is a dream? And is not our life a dream? I will say more. Suppose that this paradise will never come to pass (that I understand), yet I shall go on preaching it. And yet how simple it is: in one day, in one hour everything could be arranged at once! The chief thing is to love others like yourself, that's the chief thing, and that's everything; nothing else is wanted — you will find out at once how to arrange it all. And yet it's an old truth which has been told and retold a billion times — but it has not formed part of our lives! The consciousness of life is higher than life, the knowledge of the laws of happiness is higher than happiness — that is what one must contend against. And I shall.

<li>When there is freedom from mechanical conditioning, there is simplicity. The classical man is just a bundle of routine, ideas and tradition.

<li>I am going to my Father’s; and though with great difficulty I have got hither, yet now I do not repent me of all the trouble I have been at to arrive where I am. My sword I give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, and my courage and skill to him that can get it. My marks and scars I carry with me, to be a witness for me that I have fought His battles who will now be my rewarder. When the day that he must go hence was come, many accompanied him to the river-side, into which as he went, he said, "Death, where is thy sting?" And as he went down deeper, he said, "Grave, where is thy victory?"<br />
So he passed over, and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side. ~ <a href="/wiki/John_Bunyan" title="John Bunyan">John Bunyan</a></li>

<li>It is not enough to have a beautiful voice. What does that mean? When you interpret a role, you have to have a thousand colors to portray happiness, joy, sorrow, fear. How can you do this with only a beautiful voice? Even if you sing harshly sometimes, as I have frequently done, it is a necessity of expression. You have to do it, even if people will not understand. But in the long run they will, because you must persuade them of what you're doing. ~ <a href="/wiki/Maria_Callas" title="Maria Callas">Maria Callas</a></li>
<li>The changing wisdom of successive generations discards ideas, questions facts, demolishes theories. But the artist appeals to that part of our being which is not dependent on wisdom: to that in us which is a gift and not an acquisition — and, therefore, more permanently enduring. He speaks to our capacity for delight and wonder, to the sense of mystery surrounding our lives; to our sense of pity, and beauty, and pain; to the latent feeling of fellowship with all creation — and to the subtle but invincible, conviction of solidarity that knits together the loneliness of innumerable hearts: to the solidarity in dreams, in joy, in sorrow, in aspirations, in illusions, in hope, in fear, which binds men to each other, which binds together all humanity — the dead to the living and the living to the unborn. ~ <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Conrad" title="Joseph Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Nigger_of_the_%27Narcissus%27" title="The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'">The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'</a></i> ~</li>

<li>Whenever we can trace back a religion to its first beginnings, we find it free from many of the blemishes that offend us in its later phases. The founders of the ancient religions of the world, as far as we can judge, were minds of a high stamp, full of noble aspirations, yearning for truth, devoted to the welfare of their neighbors, examples of purity and unselfishness. What they desired to found upon earth was but seldom realized, and their sayings, if preserved in their original form, offer often a strange contrast to the practice of those who profess to be their disciples. ~ <a href="/wiki/Max_M%C3%BCller" title="Max Müller">Max Müller</a></li>

<li>The history of the human race has generated several papers articulating basic moral imperatives, or fundamental principles, of human coexistence that… substantially influenced the fate of humanity on this planet. Among these historic documents, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights … holds a very special, indeed, unique position. It is the first code of ethical conduct that was not a product of one culture, or one sphere of civilization only, but a universal creation, shaped and subscribed to by representatives of all humankind. Since its very inception, the Declaration has thus represented a planetary, or global commitment, a global intention, a global guideline. For this reason alone, this exceptional document — conceived as a result of a profound human self-reflection in the wake of the horrors of World War II, and retaining its relevance ever since — deserves to be remembered today.<br />

<li>We have reversed the usual classical notion that the independent "elementary parts" of the world are the fundamental reality, and that the various systems are merely particular contingent forms and arrangements of these parts.

<li>God is not, as in scholasticism, the final subject of all predicates. He is being as unpredicable. The existence of the creature, in so far as it exists, is the existence of God, and the creature’s experience of God is therefore in the final analysis equally unpredicable. Neither can even be described; both can only be indicated. We can only point at reality, our own or God’s. The soul comes to the realization of God by knowledge, not as in the older Christian mysticism by love. Love is the garment of knowledge. The soul first trains itself by systematic unknowing until at last it confronts the only reality, the only knowledge, God manifest in itself. The soul can say nothing about this experience in the sense of defining it. It can only reveal it to others. ~ <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Rexroth" title="Kenneth Rexroth">Kenneth Rexroth</a></li>

<li>The external world of physics has … become a world of shadows. In removing our illusions we have removed the substance, for indeed we have seen that substance is one of the greatest of our illusions. ... The sparsely spread nuclei of electric force become a tangible solid; their restless agitation becomes the warmth of summer; the octave of aethereal vibrations becomes a gorgeous rainbow. Nor does the alchemy stop here. In the transmuted world new significances arise which are scarcely to be traced in the world of symbols; so that it becomes a world of beauty and purpose — and, alas, suffering and evil.<br />

<li>The folly of Interpreters has been, to foretell times and things by this Prophecy, as if God designed to make them Prophets. By this rashness they have not only exposed themselves, but brought the Prophecy also into contempt.<br />
The design of God was much otherwise. He gave this and the Prophecies of the Old Testament, not to gratify mens curiosities by enabling them to foreknow things, but that after they were fulfilled they might be interpreted by the event, and his own Providence, not the Interpreters, be then manifested thereby to the world.

<li>To relate oneself in the spirit of reverence for life to the multiform manifestations of the will-to-live which together constitute the world is ethical mysticism.

<li>I was sixteen years old when the first World War broke out, and I lived at that time in Hungary.

It would have been difficult for me to prove, in any single instance, that the newspapers were wrong, but somehow, it seemed to me unlikely that the two nations located in the center of Europe should be invariably right, and that all the other nations should be invariably wrong. History, I reasoned, would hardly operate in such a peculiar fashion, and it didn't take long until I began to hold views which were diametrically opposed to those held by the majority of my schoolmates. ~ <a href="/wiki/Le%C3%B3_Szil%C3%A1rd" title="Leó Szilárd">Leó Szilárd</a></li>
<li>It is the eternal struggle between these two principles — right and wrong — throughout the world. They are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time; and will ever continue to struggle. The one is the common right of humanity, and the other the divine right of kings. It is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself. It is the same spirit that says, "You toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it." No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle. ~ <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a></li>
<li><i>He could not be captured,<br />

<p><i>With wings to his brain<br />
Can mount him and ride him<br />
Without any rein,<br />

<li>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.<br />
Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<br />
Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.<br />
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.<br />
And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. ~ <a href="/wiki/Paul_of_Tarsus" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul of Tarsus</a></li>

<li>The Great Spirit does not toil within the bounds of human time, place, or casualty.<br />

<li>The idea of "crime" in existing criminology is artificial, for what is called crime is really an infringement of "existing laws", whereas "laws" are very often a manifestation of barbarism and violence. Such are the prohibiting laws of different kinds which abound in modern life. The number of these laws is constantly growing in all countries and, owing to this, what is called crime is very often not a crime at all, for it contains no element of violence or harm. On the other hand, unquestionable crimes escape the field of vision of criminology, either because they have not recognized the form of crime or because they surpass a certain scale. In existing criminology there are concepts: a criminal man, a criminal profession, a criminal society, a criminal sect, and a criminal tribe, but there is no concept of a criminal state, or a criminal government, or criminal legislation. Consequently what is often regarded as "political" activity is in fact a criminal activity. ~ <a href="/wiki/P._D._Ouspensky" title="P. D. Ouspensky">P. D. Ouspensky</a></li>

<li>Most men judge only by their senses and let themselves be persuaded by what they see... On top of that, insufferable vanity has convinced humans that nature has been made only for them, as though the sun, a huge body four hundred and thirty-four times as large as the earth, had been lit only to ripen our crab apples and cabbages. … Do people really think that because the sun gives us light every day and year, it was made only to keep us from bumping into walls?

<li>You cannot avoid making judgements but you can become more conscious of the way in which you make them. This is critically important because once we judge someone or something we tend to stop thinking about them or it. Which means, among other things, that we behave in response to our judgements rather than to that to which is being judged. People and things are processes. Judgements convert them into fixed states. This is one reason that judgements are often self-fulfilling. ~ <a href="/wiki/Neil_Postman" title="Neil Postman">Neil Postman</a></li>
<li>It is necessary to write, if the days are not to slip emptily by. How else, indeed, to clap the net over the butterfly of the moment? for the moment passes, it is forgotten; the mood is gone; life itself is gone. That is where the writer scores over his fellows: he catches the changes of his mind on the hop. Growth is exciting; growth is dynamic and alarming. Growth of the soul, growth of the mind; how the observation of last year seems childish, superficial; how this year — even this week — even with this new phrase — it seems to us that we have grown to a new maturity. It may be a fallacious persuasion, but at least it is stimulating, and so long as it persists, one does not stagnate. ~ <a href="/wiki/Vita_Sackville-West" title="Vita Sackville-West">Vita Sackville-West</a></li>

<li>I don't know what God is, or what God had in mind when the universe was set in motion. In fact, I don't know if God even exists, although I confess that I sometimes find myself praying in times of great fear, or despair, or astonishment at a display of unexpected beauty. There are some ten thousand religious sects — each with its own cosmology, each with its own answer for the meaning of life and death. Most assert that the other 9,999 not only have it completely wrong but are instruments of evil, besides. None of the ten thousand has yet persuaded me to make the requisite leap of faith. In the absence of conviction, I've come to terms with the fact that uncertainty is an inescapable corollary of life. An abundance of mystery is simply part of the bargain — which doesn't strike me as something to lament. Accepting the essential inscrutability of existence, in any case, is surely preferable to its opposite: capitulating to the tyranny of intransigent belief. And if I remain in the dark about our purpose here, and the meaning of eternity, I have nevertheless arrived at an understanding of a few modest truths: Most of us fear death. Most of us yearn to comprehend how we got here, and why — which is to say, most of us ache to know the love of our creator. And we will no doubt feel that ache, most of us, for as long as we happen to be alive. ~ <a href="/wiki/Jon_Krakauer" title="Jon Krakauer">Jon Krakauer</a></li>

Leaders have always been the ones to stand against the society — <a href="/wiki/Socrates" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Christ</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" title="Sigmund Freud">Freud</a>, all the way down the line. ~ <a href="/wiki/Rollo_May" title="Rollo May">Rollo May</a></li>

<li><i>The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,<br />
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;<br />

Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing<br />
A local habitation and a name.</i><br />

<li>However great the work that God may achieve by an individual, he must not indulge in self-satisfaction. He ought rather to be all the more humbled, seeing himself merely as a tool which God has made use of. ~ <a href="/wiki/Vincent_de_Paul" title="Vincent de Paul">Vincent de Paul</a></li>
<li>What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease. ~ <a href="/wiki/Sun_Tzu" title="Sun Tzu">Sun Tzu</a></li>
<li>It costs so much to be a full human being that there are very few who have the enlightenment, or the courage, to pay the price … One has to abandon altogether the search for security, and reach out to the risk of living with both arms. One has to embrace the world like a lover, and yet demand no easy return of love. One has to accept pain as a condition of existence. One has to court doubt and darkness as the cost of knowing. One needs a will stubborn in conflict, but apt always to the total acceptance of every consequence of living and dying. ~ <a href="/wiki/Morris_West" title="Morris West">Morris West</a></li>
<li>The same energy of character which renders a man a daring villain would have rendered him useful to society, had that society been well organized. ~ <a href="/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft" title="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a></li>
<li>“The secret is not to dream … The secret is to wake up. Waking up is harder. I have woken up and I am real. I know where I come from and I know where I'm going. You cannot fool me anymore. Or touch me. Or anything that is mine.”<br />
I'll never be like this again, she thought, as she saw the terror in the Queen's face. I'll never again feel as tall as the sky and as old as the hills and as strong as the sea. I've been given something for a while, and the price of it is that I have to give it back.<br />
And the reward is giving it back, too. No human could live like this. You could spend a day looking at a flower to see how wonderful it is, and that wouldn't get the milking done. No wonder we dream our way through our lives. To be awake, and see it all as it really is … no one could stand that for long. ~ <a href="/wiki/Terry_Pratchett" title="Terry Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Discworld#The_Wee_Free_Men_.282003.29" title="Discworld">The Wee Free Men</a></i></li>

<li>Every hand and every hour should be devoted to rescue the world from its insanity of guilt, and to assuage the pangs of human hearts with balm and anodyne. To pity distress is but human; to relieve it is Godlike. ~ <a href="/wiki/Horace_Mann" title="Horace Mann">Horace Mann</a></li>
<li>Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past. ~ <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a></li>
<li>One might compare the relation of the ego to the id with that between a rider and his horse. The horse provides the locomotor energy, and the rider has the prerogative of determining the goal and of guiding the movements of his powerful mount towards it. But all too often in the relations between the ego and the id we find a picture of the less ideal situation in which the rider is obliged to guide his horse in the direction in which it itself wants to go. ~ <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a></li>

<li>Silence is difficult and arduous, it is not to be played with. It isn't something that you can experience by reading a book, or by listening to a talk, or by sitting together, or by retiring into a wood or a monastery. I am afraid none of these things will bring about this silence. This silence demands intense psychological work. You have to be burningly aware of your snobbishness, aware of your fears, your anxieties, your sense of guilt. And when you die to all that, then out of that dying comes the beauty of silence. ~ <a href="/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti" title="Jiddu Krishnamurti">Jiddu Krishnamurti</a></li>
<li>People talk about imitating Christ, and imitate Him in the little trifling formal things, such as washing the feet, saying His prayer, and so on; but if anyone attempts the real imitation of Him, there are no bounds to the outcry with which the presumption of that person is condemned. ~ <a href="/wiki/Florence_Nightingale" title="Florence Nightingale">Florence Nightingale</a></li>
<li>If any such lover be in earth which is continually kept from falling, I know it not: for it was not shewed me. But this was shewed: that in falling and in rising we are ever preciously kept in one Love. ~ <a href="/wiki/Julian_of_Norwich" title="Julian of Norwich">Julian of Norwich</a></li>
<li>What ideas individuals may attach to the term "Millennium" I know not; but I know that society may be formed so as to exist without crime, without poverty, with health greatly improved, with little, if any misery, and with intelligence and happiness increased a hundredfold; and no obstacle whatsoever intervenes at this moment except ignorance to prevent such a state of society from becoming universal. ~ <a href="/wiki/Robert_Owen" title="Robert Owen">Robert Owen</a></li>
<li>There seems to be a kind of order in the universe, in the movement of the stars and the turning of the earth and the changing of the seasons, and even in the cycle of human life.

<li>Climbing the dusty hill, some fair effigies that once stood for symbols of human destiny have been broken; those I still have with me show defects in this broad light.

<li>Magic words and incantations are as fatal to our science as they are to any other.

<li>This is a test. Take notes. This will count as 3/4 of your final grade. Hints: remember, in chess, kings cancel each other out and cannot occupy adjacent squares, are therefore all-powerful and totally powerless, cannot affect each other, produce stalemate. Hinduism is a polytheistic religion; the sect of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atman" class="extiw" title="w:Atman">Atman</a> worships the divine spark of life within Man; in effect saying, "<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_Art_God" class="extiw" title="w:Thou Art God">Thou art God</a>."

<li>What I am interested in is the relationship between the blundering human being and God. I belong to no church, but I have a religious faith; it's an attempt to express that, among other things, that I try to do. Whether he confesses to being religious or not, everyone has a religious faith of a kind. I myself am a blundering human being with a belief in God who made us and we got out of hand, a kind of Frankenstein monster. Everyone can make mistakes, including God. I believe God does intervene; I think there is a Divine Power, a Creator, who has an influence on human beings if they are willing to be open to him. ~ <a href="/wiki/Patrick_White" title="Patrick White">Patrick White</a></li>
<li>Religious and philosophical beliefs are, indeed, as dangerous as fire, and nothing can take from them that beauty of danger.

<li>It is hopelessness even more than pain that crushes the soul.

Every transition from major to minor in a sonata, every transformation of a myth or a religious cult, every classical or artistic formulation was, I realized in that flashing moment, if seen with a meditative mind, nothing but a direct route into the interior of the cosmic mystery, where in the alternation between inhaling and exhaling, between heaven and earth, between Yin and Yang, holiness is forever being created. ~ <a href="/wiki/Hermann_Hesse" title="Hermann Hesse">Hermann Hesse</a></li>

<li>When from a long-distant past nothing subsists, after the people are dead, after the things are broken and scattered, still, alone, more fragile, but with more vitality, more unsubstantial, more persistent, more faithful, the smell and taste of things remain poised a long time, like souls, ready to remind us, waiting and hoping for their moment, amid the ruins of all the rest; and bear unfaltering, in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence, the vast structure of recollection. ~ <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Proust" title="Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust</a></li>

<li>I have to say, I think that we are in some kind of final examination as to whether human beings now, with this capability to acquire information and to communicate, whether we're really qualified to take on the responsibility we're designed to be entrusted with.

<li>It is the individual only who is timeless. Societies, cultures, and civilizations — past and present — are often incomprehensible to outsiders, but the individual's hunger, anxieties, dreams, and preoccupations have remained unchanged through the millennia.

<li>Whether religion is a divisive or reconciling force depends on our certainty or our humility as we practice our faith in our politics. If we believe that we know God's truth and that we can embody that truth in a political agenda, we divide the realm of politics into those who are on God's side, which is our side, and those with whom we disagree, who oppose the side of God. This is neither good religion nor good politics. It is not consistent with following a Lord who reached out to a variety of people — prostitutes, tax collectors, lepers. If politics is the art of compromise, certainty is not really politics, for how can one compromise with God's own truth? Reconciliation depends on acknowledging that God's truth is greater than our own, that we cannot reduce it to any political platform we create, no matter how committed we are to that platform, and that God's truth is large enough to accommodate the opinions of all kinds of people, even those with whom we strongly disagree. ~ <a href="/wiki/John_Danforth" title="John Danforth">John Danforth</a></li>

<p>On September 11, 2001, in our time of grief, the American people came together. We offered our neighbors a hand, and we offered the wounded our blood.

We were also united in our resolve to protect our nation and to bring those who committed this vicious attack to justice. … The cause of securing our country is not complete. But tonight, we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to.

<li>No one would have believed, in the last years of the nineteenth century, that human affairs were being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their affairs they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet, across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. ~ <a href="/wiki/H._G._Wells" title="H.

<li>We must not conclude merely upon a man's haranguing upon liberty, and using the charming sound, that he is fit to be trusted with the liberties of his country. It is not unfrequent to hear men declaim loudly upon liberty, who, if we may judge by the whole tenor of their actions, mean nothing else by it but <i>their own liberty</i>, — to oppress without control or the restraint of laws all who are poorer or weaker than themselves. It is not, I say, unfrequent to see such instances, though at the same time I esteem it a justice due to my country to say that it is not without shining examples of the contrary kind; — examples of men of a distinguished attachment to this same liberty I have been describing; whom no hopes could draw, no terrors could drive, from steadily pursuing, in their sphere, the true interests of their country; whose fidelity has been tried in the nicest and tenderest manner, and has been ever firm and unshaken.<br />
The sum of all is, if we would most truly enjoy this gift of Heaven, let us become a virtuous people. ~ <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Adams" title="Samuel Adams">Samuel Adams</a></li>
<li>The superior man examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and that he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself.

<li>There are no exact guidelines. There are probably no guidelines at all. The only thing I can recommend at this stage is a sense of humor, an ability to see things in their ridiculous and absurd dimensions, to laugh at others and at ourselves, a sense of irony regarding everything that calls out for parody in this world. In other words, I can only recommend perspective and distance. Awareness of all the most dangerous kinds of vanity, both in others and in ourselves. A good mind. A modest certainty about the meaning of things. Gratitude for the gift of life and the courage to take responsibility for it.

<li>Children understand very well that in each woman, in each man, in each child, there is capacity of waking up, of understanding, and of loving. Many children have told me that they cannot show me anyone who does not have this capacity. Some people allow it to develop, and some do not, but everyone has it.

<li>Everywhere the need exists for maternal sympathy and help, and thus we are able to recapitulate in the one word motherliness that which we have developed as the characteristic value of woman.

<li>All great human deeds both consume and transform their doers. Consider an athlete, or a scientist, or an artist, or an independent business creator.

<li><a href="/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">Truth</a> shall prevail — don't you know <i><a href="/wiki/Greatness" title="Greatness">Magna</a> est veritas</i> … Yes, when it gets a chance. There is a <a href="/wiki/Law" title="Law">law</a>, no doubt — and likewise a law regulates your <a href="/wiki/Luck" title="Luck">luck</a> in the throwing of dice. It is not <a href="/wiki/Justice" title="Justice">Justice</a> — the servant of men, but accident, hazard, <a href="/wiki/Fortune" title="Fortune">Fortune</a> — the ally of patient <a href="/wiki/Time" title="Time">Time</a> — that holds an even and scrupulous balance. ~ <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Conrad" title="Joseph Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a></li>

<li>Once a man has tasted <a href="/wiki/Freedom" title="Freedom">freedom</a> he will never be content to be a <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slave</a>. That is why I believe that this frightfulness we see everywhere today is only temporary.

<li>Being able to do as one pleases is the <a href="/wiki/Nature" title="Nature">natural</a> goal of the <a href="/wiki/Libertarian" title="Libertarian" class="mw-redirect">libertarian</a>, but having nothing to do is not. While it may be correct to say that the human species is badly prepared for having nothing to do, it is quite a different matter to say that it is badly prepared for the <a href="/wiki/Freedom" title="Freedom">freedom</a> to do as one pleases.

<li>There are <a href="/wiki/Metaphysics" title="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> problems, which cannot be disposed of by declaring them meaningless. For, as I have repeatedly said, they are "beyond <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a>" indeed and demand an act of <a href="/wiki/Faith" title="Faith">faith</a>. We have to accept this fact to be <a href="/wiki/Honesty" title="Honesty">honest</a>.

<li>A <a href="/wiki/Good" title="Good" class="mw-redirect">good</a> cause can become bad if we fight for it with means that are indiscriminately <a href="/wiki/Homicide" title="Homicide">murderous</a>. A bad cause can become good if enough <a href="/wiki/People" title="People">people</a> fight for it in a spirit of comradeship and self-sacrifice.

<li><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebenezer_Scrooge" class="extiw" title="w:Ebenezer Scrooge">Scrooge</a> was better than his <a href="/wiki/Words" title="Words">word</a>. … He became as <a href="/wiki/Good" title="Good" class="mw-redirect">good</a> a <a href="/wiki/Friend" title="Friend" class="mw-redirect">friend</a>, as good a master, and as good a <a href="/wiki/Man" title="Man">man</a>, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old <a href="/wiki/World" title="World">world</a>. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was <a href="/wiki/Wisdom" title="Wisdom">wise</a> enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of <a href="/wiki/Laughter" title="Laughter">laughter</a> in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> laughed: and that was quite enough for him.<br />
He had no further intercourse with <a href="/wiki/Spirits" title="Spirits">Spirits</a>, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep <a href="/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> well, if any man alive possessed the <a href="/wiki/Knowledge" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a>. May that be truly said of us, and all of us!

<li><b><a href="/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">LIBERATION</a> LEADS TO LIBERATION.</b><br />
These are the first words of <a href="/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">truth</a> — not truth in quotation marks but truth in the <a href="/wiki/Reality" title="Reality">real</a> meaning of the <a href="/wiki/Words" title="Words">word</a>; truth which is not merely <a href="/wiki/Theory" title="Theory" class="mw-redirect">theoretical</a>, not simply a word, but truth that can be realized in practice. The meaning behind these words may be explained as follows:<br />
By liberation is meant the liberation which is the aim of <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">all schools</a>, all <a href="/wiki/Religion" title="Religion">religions</a>, at all <a href="/wiki/Time" title="Time">times</a>.<br />
This liberation can indeed be very <a href="/wiki/Greatness" title="Greatness">great</a>. All men <a href="/wiki/Desire" title="Desire">desire</a> it and strive after it.

We have more or less the same bodies, but very different kinds of thoughts.

<li>My goal as an <a href="/wiki/Acting" title="Acting">actor</a> is always to be as truthful as possible, and to find the <a href="/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">truth</a> in the material I am representing.

<li>You will hear people say that <a href="/wiki/Poverty" title="Poverty">poverty</a> is the best spur to the <a href="/wiki/Artist" title="Artist" class="mw-redirect">artist</a>. They have never felt the iron of it in their flesh. They do not know how mean it makes you. It exposes you to endless humiliation, it cuts your wings, it eats into your <a href="/wiki/Soul" title="Soul">soul</a> like a cancer. It is not <a href="/wiki/Wealth" title="Wealth">wealth</a> one asks for, but just enough to preserve one's <a href="/wiki/Dignity" title="Dignity">dignity</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Work" title="Work">work</a> unhampered, to be <a href="/wiki/Generosity" title="Generosity">generous</a>, <a href="/wiki/Honesty" title="Honesty">frank</a> and <a href="/wiki/Independence" title="Independence">independent</a>.

<li>Every <a href="/wiki/Science" title="Science">science</a> has for its basis a system of <a href="/wiki/Principles" title="Principles">principles</a> as fixed and unalterable as those by which the <a href="/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">universe</a> is regulated and governed. <a href="/wiki/Man" title="Man">Man</a> cannot make principles, he can only discover them. ~ <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Paine" title="Thomas Paine">Thomas Paine</a></li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Tests" title="Tests">test</a> of our <a href="/wiki/Progress" title="Progress">progress</a> is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little. ~ <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> ~</li>
<li>Are the <a href="/wiki/Mysticism" title="Mysticism">mystics</a> and sages <a href="/wiki/Insanity" title="Insanity">insane</a>? Because they all tell variations on the same story, don't they? The story of awakening one morning and discovering you are one with <a href="/wiki/The_All" title="The All">the All</a>, in a timeless and <a href="/wiki/Eternity" title="Eternity">eternal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Infinity" title="Infinity">infinite</a> fashion. Yes, maybe they are crazy, these divine <a href="/wiki/Fools" title="Fools">fools</a>. Maybe they are mumbling idiots in the face of the Abyss. Maybe they need a nice, understanding therapist. Yes, I'm sure that would help. But then, I wonder. Maybe the <a href="/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> sequence really is from matter to body to <a href="/wiki/Mind" title="Mind">mind</a> to <a href="/wiki/Soul" title="Soul">soul</a> to spirit, each transcending and including, each with a <a href="/wiki/Greatness" title="Greatness">greater</a> depth and greater <a href="/wiki/Awareness" title="Awareness">consciousness</a> and wider embrace. And in the highest reaches of <a href="/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, maybe, just maybe, an individual's consciousness does indeed touch infinity — a total embrace of the entire <a href="/wiki/Kosmos" title="Kosmos" class="mw-redirect">Kosmos</a> — a Kosmic consciousness that is Spirit awakened to its own true <a href="/wiki/Nature" title="Nature">nature</a>. It's at least plausible. And tell me: is that story, sung by mystics and sages the world over, any crazier than the <a href="/wiki/Science" title="Science">scientific</a> materialism story, which is that the entire sequence is a tale told by an idiot, full of <a href="/wiki/Sound" title="Sound">sound</a> and fury, signifying absolutely <a href="/wiki/Nothing" title="Nothing" class="mw-redirect">nothing</a>? Listen very carefully: just which of those two stories actually sounds totally insane? ~ <a href="/wiki/Ken_Wilber" title="Ken Wilber">Ken Wilber</a></li>
